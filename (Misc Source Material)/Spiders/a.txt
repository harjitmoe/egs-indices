In order to solve puzzles, you write words and, assuming it&#39;s been programmed into the game, whatever you wrote appears. For example, you can write "knight" and a knight will appear, sword in hand. The number of different words the game recognizes number in thousands.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I found myself getting bored with this game. For everything it has going for it, moving the character around is awkward, and most of the things I&#39;d like to be able to do simply aren&#39;t possible. I can imagine it being a fun diversion on occasion, but I seem to have much more fun with simple paper and pencils. For one thing, if <em>I</em> draw a badger, it is <em>ferocious.</em><br /><br />One issue I have with the game is that while you can write a huge variety of words and get those things to appear, there often seems to be little incentive to get overly specific. Take, for example, writing "cheerleader". Given the graphics, expecting a sexy blond woman with pompoms to appear would be nothing if not unreasonably optimistic, but there could at least be something that defines her as a cheerleader beyond wearing what might be a skirt.<br /><br />I would&#39;ve liked to have seen some sort of gameplay benefit, such as cheering on other characters to make them do whatever they&#39;re doing faster, or drawing the attention of hostiles away from others. The usefulness of such abilities would be limited, but at least it would feel like actually summoning a cheerleader and not someone simply dressed like one.<br /><br />Actually, the ability to become the instant target of hostiles would be very useful. Sarah&#39;s predicament in the comic is based on an actual puzzle, and an issue I ran into was the dinosaur destroying its own egg while fighting off whatever I threw at it. There were other solutions, but I ultimately wanted to safely lure it away from its egg. A cheering cheerleader drawing too much attention to herself could have been ideal, if not a bit morbid.<br /><br />Ultimately, I guess that&#39;s my whole point right there. The game manages to feel like it limits your options in spite of how many thousands of options it gives you. What you can actually do is more dependent on the creators&#39; imagination than your own. I think I&#39;ll be sticking with pencil and paper.<br /><br />Tags: Elliot, Sarah, video games', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2009-11-05', 'Id': 2, 'DateStatedAboveComic': None}, 3: {'Commentary': '<a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=http://www.egscomics.com/egsnp/?date=2009-10-29%26title%3DVampire%2BRomances"> <img src="http://cdn.stumble-upon.com/images/120x20_su_black.gif" /> </a><br /><br /><em>EGS:NP is a sub-comic of <a href="/">El Goonish Shive</a>. It is advised that one read El Goonish Shive comics prior to EGS:NP to avoid confusion and spoilers.</em><br /><br />I&#39;ve commented on this before, but I really do find the romantic appeal of vampires to be a little odd. I can understand some aspects of it, but the deal breaker in regards to my comprehension is that we&#39;re food to vampires. There&#39;s the romanticized "I don&#39;t drink <em>human</em> blood and try to be good" versions, and there&#39;s sort of a rebellious appeal to that which I can better understand. Nonetheless, I can&#39;t help but poke fun.<br /><br />One issue I have with vampires is not vampires themselves, but how saturated the vampire market has become. They&#39;re everywhere, and finding decent vampire fiction amongst all that is available is no doubt tricky. I&#39;ve liked Buffy and Angel, and the vampires in the Dresden Files are cool, but I consider the majority of the market a scary minefield.<br /><br />Also, for each incarnation, they have to spend at least one scene explaining exactly what variety of vampires is being dealt with. I know it&#39;s something they have to do, but I can&#39;t help but be instantaneously bored during such moments (with the exception, once again, of in the Dresden Files). Must be karmic retribution for all the times I&#39;ve over-explained things.<br /><br />Frankly, if you want evidence that we&#39;ve officially gone nuts over this whole vampire craze, look no further than this <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Gaming-Energy-Drink-Set-Potion/dp/B002TYGHQG/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=toys-and-games&qid=1256768439&sr=1-3>blood bag "energy potion".</a> I&#39;ve seen these things for sale.

As much as I like that idea conceptually, however, I think Tedd being the horse is funnier.<br /><br />I also like the line "100% horse". I&#39;m going to try to work it into everyday conversation. Wish me luck!<br /><br />I&#39;m experimenting with the fashion of the characters, and one idea I have for Tedd and Grace is a theme of loose fitting clothing. The difference between the two is Grace would wear clothing designed to be loose, whereas Tedd  looks like he&#39;s wearing clothes that are simply too big for him. In this strip, Grace is wearing a style that actually exists and is intentionally over-sized, while Tedd probably should&#39;ve bought a smaller lab coat.<br /><br />Speaking of fashion, there&#39;s Tedd&#39;s glasses. As established early on, they can be used to enhance how he sees things, so I figure it would be common for him to wear his glasses while in the process of experimenting and building things. I prefer he have them off in most cases so he can be more expressive with his eyes, but I think it&#39;s good to keep them around for times when they would logically be useful.<br /><br />Tags: Tedd, Grace, tf, animal', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2009-11-19', 'Id': 4, 'DateStatedAboveComic': None}, 5: {'Commentary': '<a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=http://www.egscomics.com/egsnp/?date=2009-11-12%26title%3DRevenge%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bskirts"> <img src="http://cdn.stumble-upon.com/images/120x20_su_black.gif" /> </a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/95541-Skirt-Kept-Peach-Out-of-New-Super-Mario-Brothers">No, I&#39;m not making this up.</a> When I first heard that you play as Mario, Luigi, and two Toads in the multiplayer of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002BRZ9G0/?tag=elgoonishsh04-20">new Mario game</a>, I questioned the lack of Princess Peach for only a moment before concluding that it simply didn&#39;t fit the epically complex story for her to be playable. It never occurred to me that it might be a programming issue.<br /><br />Granted, based on what Miyamoto said in the article and the reality that skirts have been programmed into games before (and with Princess Peach, no less), I suspect it has more to do with Peach&#39;s height than her skirt that she&#39;s not playable. The Toads may be shorter than Mario and Luigi, but their hats are huge and help level the playing field. Peach would either need to shrink or have clipping issues to be equal to the others.<br /><br />Nonetheless, Miyamoto mentioned skirts, and Susan has a history with skirts. Mario combined with angry Susan and dressing up my characters as a result of an actual statement by Shigeru Miyamoto? How could I resist?<br /><br />I was actually looking forward to posting this comic on the same day the new game comes out, as new games are often available on Tuesdays and EGS:NP is currently on a Tues/Thurs schedule.

In actuality, the confusion was resolved when the cashier held up a plate for eating in the food court in one hand and a container for taking the food elsewhere in the other, at which point the customer pointed at the container.<br /><br />I believe that if you&#39;re going to live in a country, you should learn at least one of the dominant languages (which, in the USA, would be English), but that&#39;s much easier said then done and I don&#39;t blame the cashier for this moment of frustration. Given her limited knowledge of English, she wasn&#39;t in a position to rephrase the question, and she was the one to eventually stop the madness.<br /><br />No, I blame the customer. I can understand someone repeating themselves the exact same way once given the possibility of the other person not hearing it the first time, but anything beyond that and they&#39;re just wasting everyone&#39;s time by not rephrasing. In this case, the obvious alternative was provided for them: "to go."<br /><br />I witness this sort of thing frequently, and only on rare occasions is there an actual language gap involved. I&#39;m not sure what it is, but it seems like people get attached to one particular way of saying something and don&#39;t want to have to put it another way if somebody doesn&#39;t understand what they mean by it.<br /><br />It&#39;s possible, like the cashier, that one may not know how else to put it, but I think that&#39;s rare. Short of something the speaker doesn&#39;t really understand themselves, they should be able to clarify what they&#39;re talking about by putting it another way. With a little effort, there could be a whole lot less confusion and frustration in the world.<br /><br />------<br /><br />Okay, time to come down off my high horse. I think I know how to get off of this thing safe--<br /><br />*thwump*<br /><br />...ow.<br /><br />Anyway, I&#39;m experimenting with Justin&#39;s look to the point where I have him introduce himself in panel one to avoid confusion. If he looks strong and huggable, then victory is mine.<br /><br />I&#39;m also making an effort to expand on Justin&#39;s character. Thinking of EGS:NP comics for him to be in feels like it&#39;s resulting in more meaningful development for him than most of the story comics have, and I&#39;m gaining similar insights into other characters the same way. Ultimately, it&#39;s the little things that help define a character and make them believable, and EGS:NP is helping me work out the finer points of my characters.<br /><br />In other words, expect to see more of Justin in EGS:NP. Well, expect to see more of everyone, really, but I wind up not using Justin and Sarah as much as I&#39;d like to in the story comics, so I&#39;m perfectly happy to highlight their presence in EGS:NP.<br /><br />Tags: Justin', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2009-11-17', 'Id': 8, 'DateStatedAboveComic': None}, 9: {'Commentary': '<a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=http://www.egscomics.com/egsnp/?date=2009-11-26%26title%3DTG%2BChampions"> <img src="http://cdn.stumble-upon.com/images/120x20_su_black.gif" /> </a><br /><br />I wound up trying <a href="http://amazon.com/dp/B002JTX63S/?tag=elgoonishsh04-20">Champions Online</a> after a friend of mine hyped its character creation system to me. It&#39;s a game where you play online as a super hero, and the amount one can customize a character really is amazing.<br /><br /><em>(incidentally, I didn&#39;t plan this, but Champions is apparently <a href=http://champions-online.com/node/594738>free to try out this weekend. starting today at 10:00 a.m. PST.</a> Go figure.)</em><br /><br />What Tedd states in this comic is accurate. You can have multiple looks for each character via "costumes" and have every costume appear completely different with the exception of gender. Your character can go from a 4&#39;7" scrawny human with a cat tail to a 7&#39;0" winged cyborg behemoth between costumes, but they have to stay the same sex while doing it.<br /><br />With the exception of the last panel, this is a genuine comment and suggestion I&#39;m putting forth. There are several legitimate reasons why one would want access to both genders for a single character, and that includes plenty of non-dirty minded reasons. A female character who doesn&#39;t want power armor with prominent breasts is a genuine example.<br /><br />Another reason? There&#39;s a night club in the game where people can gather, and I can think of no faster way to get a jerk who can&#39;t take a hint to back off from a female character than insta-morphing into a bulky male form. I could&#39;ve used that ability at least once; would&#39;ve been a nice alternative to having to go so far as to report the guy.<br /><br />(Not that I want to give the impression that the club is a bad place, mind you. I chatted with Mookie of <a href=http://www.dominic-deegan.com/>Dominic Deegan</a> there once, which was fun, and it&#39;s the one place in the game where 90+% of the people seem to stay in character.)<br /><br />I can think of several technical reasons why they don&#39;t allow the option. For one thing, not all costume pieces have cross-gender counterparts, meaning the opposite sex version might look fairly different in some ways. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good enough reason, though. The player can further tailor the costume to their liking, and there could be default settings to handle such issues. There are likely complications beyond that, but if they can reasonably make it happen, I think it would be worth doing.<br /><br />Overall, I think the game is pretty good, but it has yet to take over my life and keep me from my responsibilities. Isn&#39;t taking over everything, like, a feature on the back of the box with these kinds of games? I was all set to put it in charge, but I&#39;m still running the show.

I&#39;ve put off posting it due to Ellen and Nanase being in it, as the timing of the strip with the story comics would have felt contradictory to the jeopardy they were both in. Also, Nanase&#39;s black hair had not yet been introduced.<br /><br />This comic is a comment on the video game <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fable_2>Fable 2</a>. I don&#39;t bother mentioning it in the strip, as I figured people would either know what it is and recognize it, or not know the specific game while still getting that it&#39;s a comment on some game due to the dialogue. I wrote a script that was more direct about it, but it felt like boring talking heads. Besides which, I grew up on <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_simpsons>the Simpsons</a>. Half the things I laughed at were references I didn&#39;t fully get until later.<br /><br />While I am a fan of the Fable games, I have reached the conclusion that creator <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Molyneux>Peter Molyneux</a> is more concerned with sticking to a theme than making a fun game. Fable 2 introduced numerous clothing options to the series, allowing you to mix and match your outfits, modify the colors thereof, and do so without it impacting your stats.<br /><br />My first few hours playing the game, once out of the tutorial part, were spent earning money and<em> shopping!</em> I was obviously initially thrilled with these new options. My female hero, whose outfit and haircut wound up similar to what Nanase has here, had an expansive wardrobe with custom color schemes and I was most pleased. This level of customizability made her feel more like my own personal character.<br /><br />Then I started using the XP I&#39;d earned to become more powerful, and my character became rapidly more muscular, tall, and overall more masculine. Part of me wanted to praise the game for having both male and female characters become more muscular as they become stronger, but I found I didn&#39;t care about that. I no longer liked how my character looked, and the only way to get the look I liked back was to weaken her.<br /><br />Beyond growing taller and bulkier, learning magic makes blue lines form on one&#39;s character. Once enough magic is known, it looks like a bunch of glowing veins, and I find it rather disgusting. I wind up keeping my magic to a minimum, which really doesn&#39;t matter much. The spells aren&#39;t all that varied and one doesn&#39;t need maximum magic power to succeed, so outside of my intentionally disgusting evil character, I don&#39;t feel much incentive to master the arcane arts.<br /><br />With both male and female characters, I would much prefer being in control of how my character looks without having to sacrifice power to do so, especially when access to varied outfits is a supposed feature. I&#39;d even accept having to buy potions in-game to get the look I want, which they actually provided in an expansion pack as an option for controlling height. No potions thus far that I know of for curing absurd manliness and glowing veins, however.<br /><br />I said earlier that I think Peter values the theme over fun, and this is but one of several examples (most others involve annoying moral dilemmas and multiplayer). This appearance issue applies to the theme because the game is obsessed with its own system of morality and your behavior affects your appearance in many ways. My character&#39;s reward for being good and pure is an annoying halo and teeth so bright they could blind someone. It&#39;s enough to make me want to have her go on a killing spree to get back down to neutral status.<br /><br />I know this won&#39;t happen, but here&#39;s what I&#39;d like to see in the third game. Stats and such would still modify appearances, but make it possible to get potions to get the exact look you want regardless of stats (and possibly even alignment / purity). There can be a quest to make this possible, and I&#39;ve even thought up what it could be:<br /><br />There is an alchemist. He can make the potions you need, but he needs an ancient tome that&#39;s kept in a museum to do so. This museum is key to a town&#39;s economy, and how well it does determines how well off the town is. The more artifacts it has and how valuable those artifacts are is what determines the value of the museum.<br /><br />One would basically have three options: trade an artifact of greater value for the tome (an artifact you can&#39;t get until later in the game, so you&#39;d have to wait), bribe the curator (an impure act that also depreciates the value of the museum), or rob the place (which would require violence, could ruin the museum, and is definitely evil). I can think of ways to make it more interesting with more options, but that&#39;s the basic idea.<br /><br />Ultimately, how good or evil one would act in this scenario would be determined by their patience and how much they want the potions. This would be a situation where the benefits of being evil and/or impure would be immediate gratification at the cost of the well being of characters in the game. I feel that&#39;s an in-game moral dilemma more compelling than a lot of the ones I&#39;ve seen in the actual games thus far, mostly because I think I would actually feel conflicted about it and waiting to get the artifact to trade with would be a genuine test of patience without stopping the game. I&#39;d be thrilled to see something like this in future Fable games.<br /><br />All in all, though, I do like the Fable games, and it would take a lot for me to not buy Fable 3 the first day it comes out. For example, if it requires using <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Natal>Project Natal</a> to play it, I may be sticking to the first two.<br /><br />...Oh! Right. Pies. Yes, you really can eat pies to keep your HP up in these games, and you really can get huge from it. You can also easily lose the weight by eating enough celery. The heroes in these games truly have odd metabolisms. I actually don&#39;t mind this at all, but given the comic, I felt I should mention it.<br /><br />As for Ellen and why she looks less heroic than Nanase, this is one of those issues I was talking about. Multiplayer in Fable 2 consists of a second player as a stock henchman assisting the first player&#39;s hero. It is impossible for two heroes to meet as, much like Highlander, there can only be one chosen hero in the game&#39;s world. Player two is but a guest, and a lackey at that. The potential fun of having two heroes interact takes a backseat to the narrative, not to mention the potential fun of their dogs meeting. Competitive games of catch, anyone?<br /><br />There&#39;s also the issue that, even if playing multiplayer online, both players share a camera view. That&#39;s not fun being set aside in favor of the theme or anything, but it just can&#39;t go without mentioning when the subject of Fable 2 multiplayer is brought up.<br /><br />Tags: Ellen, Nanase, grow, tf, Video Games, fantasy', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2009-12-01', 'Id': 11, 'DateStatedAboveComic': None}, 12: {'Commentary': '<a href="/">[size=4]<strong>EGS:NP is a sub-comic of El Goonish Shive</strong></a>[/size].<br /><br />If you have not read El Goonish Shive, EGS:NP will likely be confusing at times and full of spoilers.

The Mythbusters tackle urban myths, misconceptions, and blow stuff up. The TF Busters address questions regarding transformation and zap things.<br /><br />And no, Grace and Tedd will not continue cosplaying as Jamie and Adam beyond this comic. I believe that would be going a bit too far.<br /><br />I have a lot to say about TF Busters, but first, a paragraph of praise for what it&#39;s parodying:<br /><br />I could rant for days about how much I like Mythbusters and respect its hosts, and I really do mean respect. These guys are smart, talented, and Jamie&#39;s biography reads like some sort of folk hero. I&#39;ve had a parody comic in mind for a while where Jamie would be turned into a girl and the only thing that would bother him would be the loss of his facial hair, but I haven&#39;t made it simply due to the fact that I doubt Jamie himself would appreciate it (and that&#39;s keeping in mind that he&#39;d probably never even see it).<br /><br />Now for TF Busters. This idea goes back a few years. I actually presented it to readers as the equivalent of an improv routine. Readers could suggest transformation myths, and my characters would address them. Sounded like fun to me.<br /><br />Problem was, I must not have communicated the concept well, because I didn&#39;t get questions. I was sent ideas for experiments, how they would be conducted, what would happen, etc. All I wanted was some questions (aka a setup). Anything beyond that defeated the purpose of the improve concept. I believe my mistake was asking specifically for "myths", which I think confused people.<br /><br />Using this comic as an example, this is what I would have wanted:<br /><br />"Do transgender transformations result in immediate wardrobe malfunctions and extensive self examination?"<br /><br />This, however, is more along the lines of what I got:<br /><br />"Test if transgender transformations result in immediate wardrobe malfunctions and extensive self examination by having Tedd zap Elliot, and have Elliot have to hold up his pants and tell Tedd that they&#39;ve both been transformed before which makes the test pointless. Elliot should be in work out clothes. Also, give Tedd and Grace mustaches and have Grace&#39;s be real."<br /><br />It&#39;s like giving suggestions to an improv performance. When they ask for a place, all they&#39;re looking for is the place, not who&#39;s there or what will happen. They want the beginning, not the middle, end, or any of the finer details. The question about transformation would have been the TF Busters equivalent.<br /><br />I already have "myths" I&#39;ve come up with myself and am not currently planning to address fan questions, though it could happen in this or future installments if people send me questions I want to have Tedd and Grace address.<br /><br /><em>I don&#39;t wanna sound harsh, but I feel I should be clear: If I get sent more of a story than a question, I&#39;m likely to close the e-mail without finishing it. or not open it if I can tell from the subject line. That&#39;s actually my policy in general for when I&#39;m sent story and character ideas. It&#39;s nothing personal, but there are many reasons for it.</em><br /><br />With that out of the way, enjoy the busting ^_^<br /><br />Tags: Elliot, Grace, m2f, Tedd, tf, tf gun, TV', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2009-12-03', 'Id': 157, 'DateStatedAboveComic': None}, 158: {'Commentary': 'It&#39;s more fun if animal forms give abilities related to the animals the forms are based on, but let&#39;s face it: animals move the way they do because of how their bodies are shaped, and it&#39;s not just one or two characteristics. It&#39;s the whole of the body.<br /><br />Of course, this strip takes unreasonable expectations to an extreme, but I think Tedd forgot to factor in Grace&#39;s natural bounciness.<br /><br />My favorite "ah, no" super hero to point out is <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man>Spider-Man</a>. Spiders, along with other small creatures, can do what they do because of their tiny size. It makes even less sense than most animal-based heroes for him to get his powers from a spider. It would actually make more sense to me if he got his powers some other way and just decided to be "Spider-Man" due to the similarities (particularly in continuity where his webbing is genetic).<br /><br />Then again, now I&#39;m trying to bring logic into Spider-Man, and that can never end well.<br /><br />Tags: Grace, Tedd, tf, bunny!', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2009-12-08', 'Id': 158, 'DateStatedAboveComic': None}, 159: {'Commentary': 'No she wasn&#39;t! ...Oh, he meant the myth. Never mind. I think Susan volunteered for this myth just for the opportunity to stare Tedd down.<br /><br />The cheesy blueprint in the background of panel one is something I&#39;d like to include in every TF Buster myth, but there&#39;s only so much room per strip. It didn&#39;t work with the staging in the last two, but there was room here, so here it is. Amanda is drawn instead of Susan because I think it would have hurt the rest of the strip both to show Susan in panel one and to show her being transformed (even if just in a blueprint).<br /><br />I won&#39;t lie: I enjoy this type of transformation when it occurs in fiction. I won&#39;t apologize for that any more than I&#39;ll apologize for liking spaghetti or having brown hair.<br /><br />I would like to note, however, that I appreciate the difference between fantasy and reality. I don&#39;t care about looks when it comes to real people, I find the idea of surgically altering one&#39;s body disturbing, and I believe that anyone who would ask their mate to do so deserves to be dumped and repeatedly kicked in the crotch. I would like it if plastic surgery was only used to reconstruct after one has been seriously injured.<br /><br />EDIT: As has been pointed out to me, there are other scenarios I should have listed here as good reasons for plastic surgery. These include birth defects, sex changes, and essentially any reason one can think of that isn&#39;t purely cosmetic. <br /><br />So long as I&#39;m on the subject, I suspect if transformation technology existed, there would be a period of time when many people would try to look idealized based on their society&#39;s expectations. I then suspect people would get bored, realize the loss of individuality, and develop greater appreciation for more natural appearances. This is partially based on the fact that a lot of Hollywood actresses look the same to me to the point where the supposedly "hottest actresses" feel like a dime a dozen.<br /><br />Tags: Tedd, Susan, tf gun', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2009-12-10', 'Id': 159, 'DateStatedAboveComic': None}, 160: {'Commentary': 'If you want to see a larger version of the examples shown in panels two and three, <a href="/sketchbook/?date=2009-12-15">it can be seen in the sketchbook.</a><br /><br />I know there&#39;s no experiment, but this is the second most requested myth and I thought of a strip for it, so here we are.<br /><br />I considered many final lines for the last panel, and settled on one that draws attention to the subjectivity of attraction and how different people like different things. I had actually wanted to include that point somewhere before panel four, but there wasn&#39;t room for it.<br /><br />Personally, the idea of a modest weight gain ray has some potential appeal to me, particularly if combined with a supermodel convention. A ray that would result in unhealthy obesity holds less appeal for me. I myself am overweight, and a transformation that results in an unhealthy, tiring condition doesn&#39;t seem as fun as others <a href="/egsnp/?date=2009-12-01">(though I obviously believe there are exceptions).</a><br /><br />There are a lot of people, however, who really would like to see a fat ray and the subsequent plumpness that would result.

I think it&#39;s obvious by panel two, but we shall see...<br /><br />Anyway, I didn&#39;t have much to say about Tedd being androgynous beyond old jokes (at least without making the comic bigger), so I decided to turn it into a comment on something else.<br /><br />I believe I&#39;ve mentioned it outside of the comic itself before, but I originally pictured time within the comic progressing faster with the story slowing down a bit once they reached senior year. That has turned out to very much not be the case, but I still can&#39;t honestly say I picture these characters as the ages they&#39;re supposed to be in the continuity. It feels like they should be starting community college and dealing with stuff like figuring out what major to take later and stuff like that.<br /><br />There will be time jumps in the story, but nothing so dramatic as skipping over summer and senior year. I do want to speed things up a bit, though, and I foresee weeks to a month or two passing between future storylines being more common than not.<br /><br />As for Tedd getting a keg, well... Tedd&#39;s not the sort I see as being so reckless as to binge drink, but he is one of the main eight who would at least have a genuine interesting in trying alcohol. I personally finally tried alcohol this past year, but it barely seems to affect me and I don&#39;t miss it when I don&#39;t drink for months at a time, so I don&#39;t foresee it becoming a big part of my life.<br /><br />Tags: Grace, Tedd', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2009-12-17', 'Id': 161, 'DateStatedAboveComic': None}, 162: {'Commentary': 'Aw, Grace, how can you say no to that face in panel two?

Even if he would, he wouldn&#39;t need to. They have a simulator for this sort of thing. They could have their theoretical answer without zapping a darn thing.<br /><br />So why doesn&#39;t this strip answer what might be the #1 most requested transformation myth? Because I haven&#39;t decided. I felt a need to acknowledge the existence of this question due to how many people asked, but I don&#39;t want to settle on the answer. This strip is basically the equivalent of a magic 8-ball&#39;s "ask again later" response. It&#39;s aware of your question, but is not ready to answer.<br /><br />I will say that it&#39;s unlikely that your standard forms would do anything to Jeremy. Transformation beams act relative to their targets and analyze them before doing anything, so a V5 beam would likely analyze Jeremy and conclude "no sir, can&#39;t do it."<br /><br />The REAL mystery is clone forms, the forms that always result in an identical appearance regardless of who is zapped. The most rational answer is no; the beam would determine it isn&#39;t dealing with a bipedal being and not transform the target. Nonetheless, if there&#39;s a story to be had, there are plenty of arguments for it working.<br /><br />So, basically, this myth is tentatively "busted", but that result could be overturned in a revisit.

That&#39;s not exactly an unforgivable sin, but it means more work for me if I want to do something with a genuine myth *sniff*<br /><br />I think I&#39;d heard of the elbow myth before, but it was an e-mail from someone named Myles who reminded me of it for TF Busters.

Granted, it&#39;s physically impossible to kiss one&#39;s own elbow, so they&#39;re not having much luck testing it, but at least they&#39;re trying!<br /><br />I actually prefer avoiding putting the characters in overly-skimpy outfits these days, but I think I possibly should&#39;ve drawn Grace in something skimpier in panel two.

Tedd looks adequately ridiculous, but Grace looks sort of cool (by my warped standards, at any rate).<br /><br />So, yeah.

There was a Halloween episode of one of the newer Scooby series that had Kiss in it that was hilarious and even managed to sneak in somewhat subtle jokes cleary meant for older viewers. That, in my opinion, elevates it above a kids&#39; show into a family show, and I apploud any series that does that.<br /><br />Anyway, Grace is dressed in the classic Daphne garb in the last panel, but Tedd&#39;s dressed in the modern Velma outfit (the classic outfit is more bulky and lumpy). I was actually going to make Tedd dressed like Fred, but really, there are just so many reasons he had to wind up looking like Velma.<br /><br />The shades of grey used are based on a cast image from Scooby Doo that I converted to greyscale, upped the contrast on, and converted to my palette. Grace&#39;s Daphne outfit is a little darker than the results I got simply because her hair is longer than Daphne&#39;s and the overlap hurt the contrast.<br /><br />Tags: Tedd, Grace, tf gun, tf, m2f', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2010-01-05', 'Id': 166, 'DateStatedAboveComic': None}, 167: {'Commentary': 'TF Busters, or at least this installment, concludes with this strip.

No tracing or copy/pasting occurred, though I did look at references. I tried to draw them on-model only because their actual appearances are relevant to the subject being commented on, and a "in my style" rendition would not have worked as examples. Given that they&#39;re on model, however, an additional disclaimer was added to the copyright information, and I&#39;d like to again point out that Lola is owned by Warner Bros while Marge and Lois are owned by Twentieth Century-Fox.

In his own words (season 4, <em>Last Exit To Springfield</em> commentary): "...she was a rabbit, that was the original, secret plan. But then, it turned into a series, the series caught on, and it seemed like a really bad idea." Incidentally, the "hired goons" line from that episode may or may not have had a meaningful impact on me.<br /><br />This is something I&#39;ve occasionally ranted about, but haven&#39;t seen pointed out elsewhere. My intent is not to mock furries, <em><a href=http://www.hulu.com/the-simpsons>The Simpsons</a></em> or <em><a href=http://www.hulu.com/family-guy>Family Guy</a></em>, or people who find some of the characters within attractive. The point is the likely unintentional hypocrisy of some people who mock others who have admitted to thinking one or more anthropomorphic characters are sexy.<br /><br />I don&#39;t have a problem with people making some jokes about sexy anthropomorphic characters. On the surface, there&#39;s every reason to question it, and plenty of jokes to be made. By what logic should a person find a drawing of an animal with a human body attractive? One, it&#39;s a drawing, and two, it&#39;s technically an animal. That does not compute!<br /><br />But here&#39;s the thing: We&#39;re talking about a matter of attraction. Humans are not designed to be logical about this sort of thing. In fact, we&#39;re designed to be fairly lazy in regard to what we find attractive. Logically, men should find women with proportions conducive to child bearing more attractive than women with exaggerated measurements not conducive to child bearing, but studies have suggested otherwise. We care less about the logical conclusion than the hourglass visual, hence why characters like <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Who_Framed_Roger_Rabbit_characters#Jessica_Rabbit>Jessica Rabbit</a> (who is not actually a rabbit) get so much attention.<br /><br /><em>(The specific study I&#39;m referring to was included in a [i]Discovery Channel </em>special called "The Science Of Sex", which I&#39;ve unfortunately found difficult to track down again).[/i]<br /><br />When it comes to drawings, I believe it is the suggestion of an attractive figure that allows for attractive characters. There are of course other factors, but I speak from a visual standpoint at its most basic. A simplified character might not be sexy in and of themselves, but they suggest something that is.<br /><br />As for anthropomorphic characters, the "oh, gross, they&#39;re animals" reaction is, I feel, unfair. For one thing, look at the bodies of these characters. Yes, they might have tails, weird feet, faces, whatever, but the torsos and most of the arms and legs are human in design. The bizarre feet and face may be odd, but as with the example in the comic, it&#39;s not like there aren&#39;t many "human" characters who aren&#39;t just as weird. Marge Simpson has been featured in <em>Playboy Magazine</em>, and just look at her head. That is NOT a human head. The eyes are huge, the overbite makes me think of a gopher, etc.<br /><br />I&#39;m not saying everyone secretly thinks cartoon characters can be sexy or if someone likes Marge they must like Lola. I am saying, though, that it&#39;s not fair or necessary to knock people for thinking anthropomorphic characters can be sexy, especially if one thinks "human" cartoon characters can be sexy.<br /><br />I do understand why this is such a touchy issue, however. For one thing, there is the uncanny valley of sexiness. Something that is almost sexy but isn&#39;t for some reason is often viewed as repulsive by those who feel that way to the point where it can drive them to fear and erratic behavior.<br /><br />I believe this is, in part, a result of the fact that many things we find sexy are only pleasing to the eye because our hormones tell us "yes, that is awesome". Without the hormones backing us up, those same things can easily become repulsive. Combine that with a fear of finding such a thing attractive, and the emotional logic behind some of the hostility people have towards certain things becomes frighteningly clear.<br /><br />I&#39;m aware this is starting to sound a little overly dramatic given the subject matter of the comic, but there are people out there who can be extremely hostile towards anyone they perceive as being "furries". and the hostility I speak of relates to other things, such as homophobia.<br /><br />That said, I did not choose Justin for this comic because he&#39;s gay. I chose him because of his personality and his job at a comic book shop, AKA the real world equivalent of an internet forum. Gay does not automatically equal furry, furry does not automatically equal gay, and one does not necessarily support the other. Believe me, I know. I have a gay friend who is, to put it mildly, less than friendly towards furries.<br /><br />Speaking of the uncanny valley of sexiness, for me, an anthropomorphic character isn&#39;t repulsive so long as their heads are cartoonish and/or human enough. Lola, for example, is fine. Her head isn&#39;t attractive, but I don&#39;t find it gross, either. She&#39;s just a cute cartoon character.<br /><br />Keep her body exactly the same and plop a photo-realistic head on there, however, and that&#39;s around the time I&#39;d want to call an exorcist. I wouldn&#39;t, cause I&#39;m all tolerant n&#39; junk, but I&#39;d be lying if I said I wouldn&#39;t find that disturbing. There&#39;s a reason the majority of animal forms in EGS barely morph the heads of the characters.<br /><br />Man, this is a long rant... and I plot to rant more later in <a href=http://danshive.blogspot.com/>my blog</a> when I define "furry", which I consider to be an overloaded term. Ultimately, I just want to promote tolerance and fairness. It&#39;s fine if one finds the anthropomorphs disturbing and/or gross, but please, there is no need to be a jerk or hostile about it.

Nonetheless, as far as selfish behavior goes, I&#39;d say saving people&#39;s lives is a pretty shiny silver lining. If I was in a disaster situation with limited doctors and resources present and the caveat of being saved was that it would be by the hands of a journalist with a camera man filming it, I just can&#39;t picture myself turning away the assistance.<br /><br />Frankly, between a news report on disaster scenarios where the journalists stand in front of a camera while bad stuff happens in the background and a news report where the journalists roll up their sleeves and help out, I would rather watch the latter. I&#39;m in favor of unbiased reporting, but I don&#39;t consider news crews lending a hand during a disaster a breach of that. If anything, it would be an example of people setting things aside to help and possibly inspire others to assist.

It is my understanding that your Bridge Crew is like equipment for your ship that you can level, complete with rarities and special abilities.

A Star Trek game is one where I would totally get into the roleplaying aspect of it, even in single player, and I want the Bridge Crew to matter.

I don&#39;t want to swap him out when I get a rare drop first officer or however that works.<br /><br />That said, it does make me picture having Zachary Quinto as a first officer and then replacing him after getting Leonard Nimoy as a rare drop.

This has included harsh truths from both polite and rude sources, and while I may not have liked hearing it (particularly from the rude sources), it has overall been invaluable.<br /><br />So what&#39;s up with panel four? Frankly, it&#39;s inspired by several people I&#39;ve encountered, both online and off, who don&#39;t seem to realize the value of politeness, or simply don&#39;t care. People who seem to believe that their advice should be cherished by all regardless of how they present it, and that those who fail to cherish it are arrogant.<br /><br />These people are usually right about at least one thing, and that is that their advice, if good, should be listened to regardless of how they present it. The problem is that part of how we value bits of advice is by evaluating their sources, and if all one really knows about the source is a) the advice they&#39;ve given and b) how they&#39;ve presented it, the rude approach is full of problems.<br /><br />First off, I consider what I&#39;m about to say a matter of common sense. When talking to someone, being offensive is likely to put them on the defensive. Someone on the defensive is less likely to be receptive to the ideas conveyed by the individual or individuals who put them on the defensive. Therefore, when trying to persuade someone, it is usually best not to be rude. This is particularly true if one person is not familiar with the other, hence why this comic makes note of "strangers and casual acquaintances".<br /><br />When someone I don&#39;t know well goes about giving criticism in a rude manner, it makes me suspect one of two things: they are unaware of this bit of common sense, or they don&#39;t care. The latter conclusion leads me to believe they&#39;re arrogant and possibly full of themselves, trying to get under my skin, or both. None of these conclusions make me confidant about their advice.<br /><br />Now, if I know someone well enough, it&#39;s less of an issue. If certain friends of mine gave rude criticism, I would shake my head, say "that&#39;s my pal!", and the studio audience would clap wildly as I considered what they had to say.<br /><br />If, however, someone is a complete stranger who is perhaps, I don&#39;t know, e-mailing me, and the first impression they make is that of a rude jerk? It&#39;s extremely unlikely I will consider whatever they have to say worthwhile, and I will most likely not finish reading it. Life is too short to waste on internet jerks, and if whoever was e-mailing me really was trying to give good advice, well...

Elliot&#39;s in a position to take that pawn before or after it becomes queen, but if he does, Tedd will take Elliot&#39;s Queen, and Tedd will still have one AND both of his rooks.</p>\n<p>In related news, I&#39;ve rediscovered that I enjoy chess. HUZZAH!</p>\n<p><strong>Timeline</strong></p>\n<p>I mentioned waaaaaay back at <a href="/egsnp.php?id=358">the start of this storyline</a> that I wasn&#39;t sure where it should fit in the timeline. I also said Tedd would be in the storyline, and I guess this makes that technically true, though I had originally planned him being in more of it.</p>\n<p>No later than around the time Sarah started c<a href="/egsnp.php?id=397">ontemplating her place on the kinsey scale</a>, I decided it would be most appropriate if this storyline took place sometime before the card tournament (and Sarah&#39;s <a href="/index.php?id=1921">&quot;I&#39;m at most a two&quot; moment</a>). I was also leaning towards &quot;the past&quot; early on (<a href="/egsnp.php?id=360">Nanase fairy with Susan</a>, anyone?), but was still undecided.</p>\n<p>Not terribly far in the past. I don&#39;t want to set a specific date on it (mostly because I&#39;m not sure when it should be), but it&#39;s pretty darn recent in the timeline, wherever the heck exactly it fits.</p>\n<p>I also decided Tedd&#39;s hair would be the most natural way to make this clear. I didn&#39;t want sudden narration without warning saying &quot;DAN DECIDED THIS WAS THE PAST&quot;, nor did I want it in some random location in the story.

Last time,I asked for people to vote for a pairing. This time, I got all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_libs">mad libby</a>. I eventually phrased the question thusly:<br /><br /><em>"I have four blanks in a sentence to fill. Character 1, Character 2, a transformation, and an electronic device. Vote for each blank."</em><br /><br />I say "eventually" because I had to restart the voting and clarify some things after people were voting for things that no one else would vote for. For example, there aren&#39;t likely to be repeat votes for a "winged purple kitty with bobcat ears" transformation, but six people voted for "half-cat". The less obscure / specific, the better the odds.<br /><br />I didn&#39;t share the sentence at any time during the voting, and I got the impression that many people expected the transformation to apply to both characters. Part of this suspicion is based on people putting "body swap" in the transformation blank, which sadly could not be counted because it didn&#39;t fit in the sentence and <a href="/egsnp/?date=2004-08-21">is not considered transformation &#39;round these parts.</a><br /><br /><strong>The Results</strong><br /><br />Susan was the winner by a long-shot for the Character 1 blank with 20 votes, 11 votes ahead of the runner-up, Elliot. She also did respectively well in the Character 2 slot with 7 votes. I&#39;m not sure what I would have done if she won both blanks... alternate universe Susan?<br /><br />Nanase won the Character 2 blank by 1 vote with a total of 9. Catalina was the runner up with 8, and I was honestly hoping Catalina would win given the lead V5 had in the transformation blank. Nanase getting zapped with V5 is, in my opinion, a bit much. I know some people will lynch me for this, but I had originally sketched Nanase in her outfit from <a href="/?date=2011-01-03">this comic</a>, but decided to cover her up more. It was, as I&#39;ve said, a bit much.<br /><br />V5 (<a href="/?date=2002-06-10">Female Variant #5</a>) won the transformation blank with 15 votes, the closest thing to competition being 7 votes for shrinking. I would say bigger is better, but growing only got 4 votes.<br /><br />And finally... Toaster. Toaster won the electronic device slot with 11 votes, beating out video game consoles by 3. I was all ready to draw someone flailing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiimote">Wiimote</a> when I checked the spreadsheet and witnessed the dominance of the toaster.<br /><br /><strong>...TOASTER?!</strong><br /><br />Okay, I&#39;m both thrilled and baffled that a damn toaster won this thing. The very fact that it won validates the "fill in the blank" voting fun, even if it can get a bit confusing. I would NEVER have thought to put "toaster" on a pre-written ballot.<br /><br />Was this organized? Is there a forum thread somewhere with a rallying cry for toasters? Did people do a search and decide to vote for toasters after they saw other people doing it? Are toasters just that universally adored? Seriously, how did a toaster win this thing?<br /><br /><strong>Ze Narrative</strong><br /><br />One of the goals for this was to take the results and draw something with the chosen characters, device and transformation while keeping everyone in character. As one might imagine, keeping this sentence in character presented a bit of a challenge.<br /><br />In the end, I went with the old cliche of disastrous things happening when one tries to fix a toaster and made the whole thing an accident.

I&#39;m sure there are plenty of moments, but they blur together for me.<br /><br />The <em>Star Wars</em> reference, however, was about a specific moment: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_solo">Han Solo</a> flying into an asteroid field. I didn&#39;t just pull the 3720:1 odds out of a hat; those were the odds <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3P0">C-3P0</a> gave Han.<br /><br />Justin&#39;s comeback, "never tell me the odds", is also specifically from that scene. Again, I&#39;m sure Kirk had his own witty retorts to being told the odds, but no specific moment stands out to me. Perhaps one would stand out to Susan, but it would probably have to be from the movies. Of the actual Trek TV shows, her favorite is <a href="/egsnp/?date=2006-08-22"><em>Deep Space Nine</em></a>.

In fact, why wouldn&#39;t she be a fan of the first three <em>Star Wars</em> movies?

Why would a grown man do such a thing? Because a ton of other grown men on the internet kept talking about how awesome they thought it was. I would literally have no idea the show even existed if not for witnessing a multitude of unsolicited praise.<br /><br />Okay, I would&#39;ve found out a few days ago on account of the first episode being free on iTunes and it being advertised on iTune&#39;s front page, but then my first exposure to it would&#39;ve been a picture of Optimus Prime, a ninja from G.I. Joe, and a crazy-happy pink pony. That was somewhat surreal even with prior knowledge.<br /><br /><strong>MY OPINION OF THE SHOW *THUNDERCLAP*</strong><br /><br />The show is shockingly good. It&#39;s what I would call a "family show" as opposed to a "kids show", the distinction in my mind being that a kids show is geared towards kids and is potentially aggravating for adults to watch. A family show, on the other hand, is still geared towards kids, but is done in such a way that adults can still enjoy watching it.<br /><br />There are many reasons I&#39;m shocked by the goodness of this show. For one thing, look at the full title: <em>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</em>. That alone is enough to set off one&#39;s gag reflex.<br /><br />What&#39;s more, the ONLY thing inaccurate about the title is the "my" part. These ponies answer to no humans, which is easy for them to do seeing as there aren&#39;t any. Friendship is a huge part of the show, and each episode ends with a lesson about friendship. That&#39;s right: this show has clearly stated morals to every episode.<br /><br />Not only that, but GET THIS! The ponies are mostly polite and nice to each other! They&#39;ll get into arguments and do plenty of rude things, but they&#39;re rarely rude on purpose, they&#39;re apologetic, teasing is almost always in good humor... IT&#39;S MADNESS!<br /><br />And yet, it&#39;s good. It&#39;s funny, it&#39;s cute, the characters are well-defined and fun, the writings solid, and the stories are good (if a little predictable from an adult&#39;s perspective). It&#39;s done so well that all the problems a show like this could easily have are small or not present at all.<br /><br />In fact, the show being good has resulted in me doing a lot of thinking, and I mean a lot. I can&#39;t remember the last time a show made me think this much. One <em>might</em> have noted a bit of hyperbole a couple paragraphs back in regard to the politeness and niceness of the characters being madness, and that&#39;s the sort of thing I&#39;ve been thinking about: why is that so weird?<br /><br />I know how dull it can be when there&#39;s no conflict between characters, but you can have conflict, anger, and all the things that make a story good without making the protagonists mean-spirited jackasses. This show is living proof of that.<br /><br />It seems like politeness and niceness in general is on the decline. Maybe that&#39;s just a result of looking at the world from where I&#39;m sitting, but I&#39;m not the only one who has expressed this sentiment, and TV shows, comics, movies, etc support it. I&#39;ve gotten looks of shock from people by doing nothing more than saying stuff like "please" and "thank you". Seriously, what the hell?<br /><br />...Okay, I&#39;ve ranted quite a bit here, and it&#39;s off the top of my head, and I&#39;m not sure how coherent it all is, so...<br /><br /><strong>To Conclude These Ramblings</strong><br /><br /><em>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</em> is a very good family show, and I think it could actually be a good influence on children (and possibly adults) without patronizing or boring them. The morals aren&#39;t too heavy-handed, the characters and stories are fun, and the amount of cuteness could probably be weaponized.<br />', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2011-02-22', 'Id': 15, 'DateStatedAboveComic': '2011-02-22'}, 16: {'Commentary': 'Scholars will theorize that this is a reference to <a href="/?date=2011-02-23">this comic</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_incredible_hulk"><em>The Incredible Hulk</em></a>.

It&#39;s a bit late in any case.)</em><br /><br />I&#39;m about the one quad-trillionth human to make this sort of "app for everything joke" (and that&#39;s only a fraction of all sentient species who have made that joke), but I acquired an iPad the day I drew this and thus was required by law to draw SOMETHING related to it.<br /><br />Besides which, this is inspired by an actual dream I had after I had placed my order. During the dream, I had a device that was iPad-sized with physical buttons that could alter reality. As one who has presumably read this comic, one could be forgiven for assuming transformation antics ensued, but I mostly used it to effectively "save" my own life&#39;s progress and jump back to previous saves. <br /><br />In short, I gave myself access to a super power every video game hero has effectively had since they started giving players nigh-unlimited save slots. One could argue it was deeply representative of my subconscious, but I&#39;m betting it had more to do with me having ordered an iPad and playing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028IBTL6?ie=UTF8&tag=elgoonishsh04-20&linkCode=as2,amp=1789,reative=390957,reativeASIN=B0028IBTL6"><em>Fallout: New Vegas</em></a> the previous day.', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2011-03-08', 'Id': 19, 'DateStatedAboveComic': '2011-03-08'}, 20: {'Commentary': '<p>This is a glimpse into some of the behind the scenes process for a <a href="/?date=2011-03-09">recent story comic</a>.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Background Guides</strong><br />\n<br />\nWhile I do know a lot about drawing in perspective, I am slow at manually setting up perspective lines. I run into trouble just getting started with proper vanishing points, to be honest. Given the number of panels I have to draw and how much I want scenes to be consistent, I used to use the shortcut of using 3D rendered scenes made in Google SketchUp as guides and references (I&nbsp;still use 3D , but have moved on to different programs, particularly after SketchUp was sold and license agreements changed).<br />\n<br />\nEven though I am using 3D software to help, however, it doesn&#39;t do all the work for me. In addition to still needing to do all the final line work and such, I have to design and create the environments. I have had to learn several architectural rules of thumb as a result, and a single environment can take a good while to make depending on how much detail there is.<br />\n<br />\nThere is the advantage that Google SketchUp has a community of modelers who share their work, but I have a tendency to want to make any models I use as reference and/or guides from scratch, thus explaining why I spent a fair amount of time on the staircase in <a href="/?date=2010-03-01">Tedd&#39;s basement</a> when I probably could&#39;ve just downloaded something. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_sagan">Carl Sagan</a> would probably have a thing or two to say about that, but whatever. I&#39;ll create a universe and apple pies later.<br />\n<br />\n<em>(For those scratching their heads, Carl Sagan quote: &quot;If you want to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first create the universe.&quot;)</em><br />\n<br />\nBesides which, my main concern with objects is where they go in the scene and what their proportions are. Which brings us to...<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Justin and Simple Guides</strong><br />\n<br />\nThe placement guide for Justin is just a line that matches his height and has rectangular dividers. The width of, length of, and distance between each divider matches the height of Justin&#39;s head (if he was bald). Most of my humanoid characters have the same head size, so it&#39;s a pretty universal unit of measure for me.<br />\n<br />\nThat&#39;s what I meant by my main concern being where the objects go and their proportions. I don&#39;t need a perfect 3D representation of what I want to draw, I just need something to keep track of where it is, how big it is, and a way to help keep the perspective right (hence the nature of the dividers).<br />\n<br />\nAnother example is Brownie. I&#39;ve kept track of <a href="/?date=2011-02-25">Brownie&#39;s placement</a> in scenes by simply using a cube with some lines on it. Anything more elaborate would be excessive.<br />\n<br />\nSpeaking of excessive...<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Noah</strong><br />\n<br />\nI have trouble drawing people running, particularly in perspective. One very simple problem I run into with running is how tall a character effectively is when they&#39;re hunched over, which was the basic problem I was trying to address when I sketched a side view of Noah running. It then occurred to me that it basically provided a guide that could translate into perspective if I was willing to do a little extra work with it.<br />\n<br />\nAnd that&#39;s why Noah has two grids instead of just a simple guide like Justin (each square in the grid equals one square head, if that makes any sense). Using the sketch as a reference and what I know about drawing in perspective, I could use those two grids to do halfway decent job of drawing running Noah in perspective, which I really wanted. While I&#39;m not entirely happy with the composition of that panel, I remain happy that I didn&#39;t just go with a side view of Noah dashing off.

Unfortunately, the Illustrator file became corrupt before I had made a separate, flat high res version of it (and subsequently the website version), and it happened in such a way that I didn&#39;t know it was corrupt until it was too late.<br /><br />The reason I wouldn&#39;t know until it was too late was because this is the sort of glitch that happens when saving the file. The file saves and everything seems fine... until you try to open or import it, and then you discover that only some of the layers still exist. I had the Illustrator file open all through the post-sketching process, so I never knew there was a problem until it was way too late to do anything about it.

I&#39;ve experimented with it in later versions and didn&#39;t encounter the corrupt save glitch again, so I started using it again where applicable. I have no idea what actually caused the problem this time. but I DID use the scissors tool at one point, and I have my suspicions.<br /><br />All I know for sure is that I am going to be saving copies and testing them all throughout the remaking of this comic, and probably with all future comics for a while, too.', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2011-05-02', 'Id': 36, 'DateStatedAboveComic': '2011-05-02'}, 37: {'Commentary': 'What?

MADNESS!<br /><br />Before I rant about a [s]childrens[/s] ADULT video game, I should note that <strong>I might take a break from sketchbook Saturday&#39;s for a while</strong>. Five story comics a week have kept me pretty busy, and most of what I&#39;ve been posting on Saturday have been last minute sketches, which wasn&#39;t my intention. I&#39;ll decide what I want to do with them and post news about it later.<br /><br />ANYWAY, the game being referenced in this comic is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Noire"><em>LA Noire</em></a>, a game which, I would like to emphasize, is an M-rated game and definitely not for kids. I&#39;m not even sure if there&#39;s any justification for rating a game "M for Mature" that isn&#39;t on the back of the box, and rightly so. I don&#39;t buy into the idea of a game like this warping young minds, but I can certainly see it troubling and disturbing young minds. Please note that I&#39;m basing this on it successfully troubling and disturbing my adult mind.<br /><br />That&#39;s not to say it&#39;s bad. It just deals with mature themes in an interactive way, and given the realistic portrayal and gruesome nature of what&#39;s on screen, it can be genuinely unsettling to look at, let alone interact with.<br /><br />But I&#39;ve gotten away from what inspired this sketchbook. <em>LA Noire</em> is, at its core, an adventure game with action scenes sprinkled on top. Unless you&#39;ve played other games where the action played similarly, this potentially means having to relearn how to fight every so often. Such was the case with me when I <em>literally forgot how to punch.</em> I checked the instruction booklet, and I found the right button, but I still couldn&#39;t punch.<br /><br />I&#39;m not the only one this has happened to, however. I know, because I found the solution to my problem in a forum thread, which was similar to another forum thread I had found, where someone was trying to figure out why they couldn&#39;t punch. We were all thinking that all we had to do was press one button to punch, one button to block, etc. We thought we had encountered some glitch that kept punching from working properly.<br /><br />Alas, such was not the case. We had foolishly forgotten that it was necessary to hold done the left trigger to fist fight. This makes me wonder why the instruction booklet only says that the left trigger is used to target as opposed to "hold this or your character will stand around like a lemon and take all manner of punishment".<br /><br />It also makes me wonder why it&#39;s necessary. You play as a detective in this game, and do not go around punching random people. If you&#39;re punching someone, it&#39;s because they started it and you are defending yourself. There are literally no other options other than defend yourself, get knocked out, or hope your partner beats them for you, so why is it necessary to hold down a button to do what should be default behavior? <br /><br />If the fighting was more complex, or if you could run around starting fights, I&#39;d understand this mechanic. As it is, however, it just feels counter-intuitive. Once someone starts a fight, your character&#39;s fists are up, so it feels like they&#39;re ready to fight. In spite of this, you can&#39;t even block unless you&#39;re holding down a button to target the only guy you could possibly want to block or hit at that moment.<br /><br />It&#39;s ultimately not that big a nitpick, and it&#39;s possible I&#39;m just missing a good reason why it works that way, but it just seems like sloppy design to me in what is otherwise a very high-end experience. I&#39;m still forming an opinion on the overall game, and this certainly isn&#39;t a deal breaker, but it&#39;s the sort of thing that makes me ask "WHY" in capital letters.<br /><br />Actually, if you know why, <a href="/contact.page">let me know.</a> Maybe that knowledge will fuel next week&#39;s sketchbook and I&#39;ll be able to draw it in advance for once.

Zelda 2 was the second Zelda game (as the cleverer among you have already deduced), and while it broke form from the other games by being a side-scroller and possessing a level of potential frustration beyond other games in the series, it did include a few awesome things.<br /><br />One of these things was the fairy spell. This spell allowed Link to instantly turn into a fairy and fly around the screen. It was cool in many ways, and may well have warped my fragile little mind. From a gameplay standpoint, it was cool because you could morph to avoid pit-deaths, fly places you couldn&#39;t normally get to, and fly around enemies.<br /><br />From less of a gamplay standpoint, I just thought it was cool that Link had a morphing ability. As you may have guessed, I think transformation is cool. As a kid, I imagined that fairy Link looked mostly identical to Spryte from the infamous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda_(TV_series)"><em>Legend of Zelda</em></a> cartoon, except with Link&#39;s hairstyle and mandatory silly hat. This should probably come as a surprise to no one.<br /><br />It&#39;s a spell I would like to see return to the Zelda games, even if it is just a miniature normal Link with wings. For one thing, flying around in a 3D perspective, when done properly, is very fun. For another, it would be cool to see the enemies from another perspective, along with everything else. Imagine Link fleeing not from a mob of small angry chickens, but instead a mob of giant ones, or even just one relatively giant chicken.

This was one of the more complicated bits of sketchery I&#39;ve had to do due to how the two characters layer and the clouds. One of the benefits of sketching entirely on the computer, however, is that instead of erasing along the way, I can just put things on separate layers, use different colors, and have layers with areas of whiteness between them to keep everything looking clean.<br /><br />Speaking of which, yes, the the fairy&#39;s clothes were on a separate layer. This was because I wasn&#39;t entirely certain of the fairy&#39;s outfit and I wanted to be able to try different things without having to erase sketches for the body. I left some transparency on the sleeves because I figured knowing where the arms are exactly might impact the shading. I don&#39;t think it actually did given that the sleeve sketches themselves provided enough detail, but that was my thinking.<br /><br />Sketching the clothes on a different layers actually isn&#39;t THAT different from the norm, though I usually just have the clothes and figures on the same layers. It&#39;s standard practice to lightly sketch out a character&#39;s unclothed figure before sketching clothes onto them. I&#39;m not going to give a detailed drawing tutorial here, but it makes sense when one thinks about it. How the clothes look is largely dependent on how they look on the figure, so it makes sense to actually draw the figure and not just draw clothes with some vague idea of where the body is underneath.<br /><br />It is worth noting that lightly sketching out the character&#39;s figure in no way necessitates drawing any covered up bits in detail, so anyone out there cursing the clothing layer of this sketch, you&#39;re basically only missing out on seeing the equivalent of a super hero in mono-color tights.

I think writers just get tired of stakes and like improvisational weaponry regardless of whether it would actually work. That&#39;s not necessarily bad, but let&#39;s be honest about the silliness.<br /><br />That said, I have a bone to pick. Several people sent me comments telling me that I had forgotten that Buffy was super strong. If I may quote myself:<br /><br /><em>When <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_%28TV_series%29"><strong>Buffy</strong></a> just sort of stabs a vampire with a stake with her otherwise bare hands and they die, <strong>that&#39;s one thing, but</strong> I seem to recall it feeling like <strong>any given character</strong> could limp-wristedly poke a vampire in the chest and the vampire would burst into ash.</em><br /><br />While I didn&#39;t explicitly call Buffy super strong, she is very clearly being noted as an exception.

Raven is one of my favorite characters to draw in the EGS style because he is simply different enough from the main characters for him to be visually interesting and fun.<br /><br />I actually think the best way for me to refine the EGS style is to draw people other than the main characters. The main characters aren&#39;t going to change much; they&#39;re established, their designs SHOULD be relatively simple and accessible, and any changes will either be plot-related or more like making corrections than actual changes. For me to actually expand upon the style and give it more life, I need to draw other characters.<br /><br />I also need to draw more full body poses. It&#39;s way too common for me to just draw them from the chest up, as I generally focus on their faces and cut off the rest to fit character and text in panel.

I generally prefer a transformation such as this to be instant, primarily because I don&#39;t really find somewhere between the before and after stages to be appealing.

Yeah, people misuse words, but those words tend to pop up a lot. How often does "parsec" get misused in everyday conversation?<br /><br />Given that he was making a movie about space wars and what-not, however, it&#39;s likely that he, or someone near him, had previously heard of parsecs and didn&#39;t really get what was meant by them.

I just point it out because people seem to want to hide that it was a mistake.<br /><br />Oh, and there&#39;s also something in the script that people cite as evidence, namely direction that has Kenobi subtly react to Han&#39;s obvious misinformation. I think it&#39;s far more likely that Han embellishing his abilities was the misinformation, not the usage of parsecs.<br /><br />I mean, seriously, we&#39;re talking about a universe where space travel is common. Parsecs should be common knowledge, and Luke was interested in piloting and joining the rebellion. He might have been a whiny farmboy, but I find it hard to believe that he wouldn&#39;t at least know the basics of what a parsec was, and given his whiny nature, he so would&#39;ve called Han out on misusing the term.<br /><br />...I swear I&#39;m not a super <em>Star Wars</em> nerd.', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2010-11-23', 'Id': 590, 'DateStatedAboveComic': '2010-11-23'}, 591: {'Commentary': 'For those of you who don&#39;t read the news section on the front page (everyone but Kevin), I hope to have the next story comic ready for Thursday.

Eh, who cares). While replacing her right hand with a hammer is the obvious choice, the idea of removing any of Susan&#39;s limbs weirds me out, so... yeah.

The only gender combination not represented was with both of them being female, but given the number of responses I received, it&#39;s possible I just don&#39;t remember it being requested.<br /><br />I finally figured it would be best to go ahead and include Susan, but I couldn&#39;t figure out what gender combination would work best if I paired her with Justin (I just realized how strange that sentence was).

And now, ze real commentary!<br /><br />Those of you who follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/dantheshive">the Twitters</a> are possibly already aware of this, but there is a tendency among political commentators and the politicians themselves that grates on my nerves. If I may quote myself from Twitterville:<br /><br />"I really frikkin&#39; hate when political commentators say "the American people want ___". There is a HUGE diversity of opinions out there. (a) it creates further divide to claim one side is "the American people", and (b) THERE WOULD BE NO DEBATE IF IT WAS UNANIMOUS."<br /><br />Point (b) is pretty self explanatory, but I want to elaborate on (a). When one says "the American people want ___", it&#39;s essentially implying that  anyone who disagrees is un-American. This is irrationally divisive in nature and counter-productive to bipartisanship.<br /><br />It&#39;s subtle propaganda (whether it&#39;s intentional or not) that&#39;s meant to get people to think the same way as the commentator or politician, and it accomplishes it in an irresponsible way. It is a cheap and manipulative method by which to convince people to pick a side. Not only should that be accomplished through logic and reasoning, but we live in a complicated world. There are usually more than two options.<br /><br />Perpetuating an us-vs-them mentality divides us, and I&#39;m pretty sure someone once said something about dividing houses and how it was detrimental to their ability to stand.<br /><br />My "let&#39;s all get in a drum circle and work together" political views aside, Susan being in this comic giving advice was a <a href="/?date=2005-03-21">no-brainer</a>, as she&#39;s no stranger to <a href="/?date=2007-08-14">making a stand</a>. My reason for having Grace holding the sign was basically, well... <a href="/?date=2002-07-08">the girl <em>can</em> be wordy</a>.<br /><br />I also think it makes sense that she would be supportive of everyone working together, and I can see her having some strong opinions now that someone&#39;s given her history books to read. Don&#39;t worry about her getting too political, though. If she starts to rant, we&#39;ll just throw shiny objects and/or <a href="/?date=2005-02-14">Tedd</a> at her.', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2010-12-09', 'Id': 596, 'DateStatedAboveComic': '2010-12-09'}, 597: {'Commentary': 'As mentioned in the <a href="/sketchbook/?date=2010-12-09">previous sketchbook comic&#39;s commentary</a>, I decided to do a survey to determine what non-canon couple would appear in this sketchbook comic. Justin and Elliot won with 13 votes, and that&#39;s not counting votes that put them together as a different combination of genders.<br /><br />Not counting different form variation requests, the runner up with 5 votes was <a href="/?date=2005-06-24">Grace with Sarah</a>. Counting form variations, I think <a href="/?date=2006-07-03">Justin and Susan</a> were the runner ups with 6. Regardless of whether form variations counted separately or not, Justin and Elliot won by a long shot with 13 or 18 votes respectively (3 of the extra 5 being in favor of <a href="/?date=2010-11-22">Mild Mannered Elliot with Justin</a>). Another popular option was <a href="/?date=2008-05-12">Susan and Catalina</a> with 4 votes.<br /><br />I normally compile survey answers in <a href="http://danshive.blogspot.com/">my blog</a>, but this one directly affected the content of this comic, so I&#39;m going to post them here instead.<br /><br />They&#39;re not listed in the order I received them, but rather as close as I could get to alphabetizing the results. For example, I roughly sorted "you should draw Justin with Elliot" as though it were "EJ", "Susan should totally be with Justin" as "JS", etc. If I ever do another survey like this, I&#39;m going to have a rule of having each tweet / e-mail start with the couple&#39;s first names in alphabetical order because sorting out the results for this was nightmarish.<br /><br />That said, some of these MIGHT be "out of order", but Justin with Elliot won by such a huge margin that I&#39;m not really going to cry if I was off by one vote somewhere (at least not until the candidates&#39; lawyers show up).<br /><br /><strong>Survey answers:</strong><br /><br />SO many choices... -evil laughter- Oh, I can&#39;t pick...

The most common complaint I&#39;ve heard is about the scene when Quorra says they can&#39;t be followed. The complaint is that she&#39;s claiming the other programs will malfunction if they go off-grid, but that&#39;s not what it sounded like to me.

I&#39;m not sure if I&nbsp;like green eyes for Nanase, and I&nbsp;feel I&nbsp;should be allowed to mulligan pretty much anything established in 2002.</p>\n<p>We&#39;ll see. For now, put Nanase&#39;s eye color down as &quot;maybe green&quot;.</p>\n<p>BUT&nbsp;ANYWAY!&nbsp;Sarah has light blue eyes simply because that&#39;s how I&#39;ve always imagined them, and Grace has green eyes because I&#39;m obsessed with keeping her color scheme in forest colors while also wanting contrast.</p>\n<p>Elliot and Ellen definitely have dark brown eyes to the point where I&nbsp;haven&#39;t actually decided if they&#39;ll even be visible in greyscale. I think there&#39;s room in the style for characters to intentionally break the mold with eyes without irises and irises that are prominent to the point of not even showing a pupil. Not certain, of course, but I&#39;d like to have some variety in that regard.</p>\n<p>Susan&#39;s eyes are most likely dark blue, and Justin&#39;s eyes are probably a  lighter brown buuuuut I haven&#39;t definitively decided. They could also  be another variety of blue. <a href="/contact.php">Feel free to weigh in.</a></p>\n<p>In any case, totally ignoring real world genetics and just going for whatever I&nbsp;think feels right / fits the color scheme.

Tedd&rsquo;s physique isn&rsquo;t terribly androgynous once you get a clear look at his/her form, but put some loose clothing on him/her, and he/she can appear to be either sex (using both pronouns as this applies to either case).</p>\n<p>In panel seven, Tedd&rsquo;s overshirt is blown open and the black shirt conforms to her figure. Shirt hanging loose: Androgynous Tedd, as the curves (or lack thereof) are hidden. Shirt open: Clearly male or female Tedd. Basically, the key to Tedd being truly androgynous is loose clothing.</p>\n<p>In panel 8, the overshirt is still open. You can&rsquo;t see below her shoulders, but the look created by it gives an implication of a female form. That said, panel 8 is definitely not artistic license, so that shirt which was keeping Tedd androgynous probably isn&rsquo;t doing that at the moment&hellip;&quot;</p>\n<p>And in response to someone declaring their disappointment that female Tedd didn&#39;t have smaller breasts:</p>\n<p>&quot;They look bigger than they are in today&rsquo;s comic. I very deliberately posed Tedd to make one visible in silhouette in order to accentuate her female form, and the blue shirt being off to the side combined with the black shirt also gives the illusion of increased size. She&rsquo;s actually comparable to Sarah.&quot;</p>', 'HtmlComicTitle': 'So Girly Tedd', 'DateInBrowserTitle': None, 'Id': 768, 'DateStatedAboveComic': '2014-07-29'}, 769: {'Commentary': '<p><a href="/image/Teddy2.png">- 1535 x 1080 version</a></p>\n<p><a href="/index.php?id=1909">- (Sort of)&nbsp;from this comic</a></p>\n<p>I&#39;m betting, however, that nobody saw THIS coming!</p>\n<p>Or maybe you did, assuming you were a <a href="http://www.patreon.com/egscomics">$3+ patron on the EGS&nbsp;Patreon</a> earlier.

The patron never said anything about it, but I felt I should do something to make up for it.

Short Susan has been enchanted by her opponent with a debuff, lowering her attack and health by 1 each.

I&#39;ve been pushing an evolution of my style with consistency of style for zoomed in and out characters being a major part of it.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve previously had an obsession with keeping general line thickness consistent no matter how zoomed in or out on a character, and it&#39;s an obsession that made it really easy to break my style.

Imagine each circle is the same size, but different distances away:</p>\n<p><img src="/image/samethickness.png" width="400" height="200" alt="" /></p>\n<p>By keeping the line thickness constant, it effectively makes the lines thicker or thinner.

I believe I was looking specifically into fashion from the 50s, or at least checking out what they wore in sitcoms set in or created during that era. The sailor outfit that Ellen is wearing in this dream is apparently something some girls wore back in the day. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what\xe2\x80\x99s sailorish about it, but it does appear to be a wardrobe cousin to the sailor fukus worn in Japan. I\xe2\x80\x99d do more research on the history of sailor variety dresses, but I feel I need to keep the trivia section of my brain open for more DVD commentaries.<br /><br />Well, that, and I fear what results I might get while doing internet searches for such things.<br /><br />I love to joke about the shipping of Elliot and Tedd (hey, another nautical-esque term!). The idea of Tedd in particular being female and with Elliot amuses me. That said, this dream is less about deep hidden feelings Elliot could have for Tedd and has much more to do with the various jokes about Elliot and Tedd being symbolic parents of Ellen.<br /><br />Lucid dreaming has long been a fascination of mine, though I\xe2\x80\x99ve never truly pulled it off. The idea is that one is dreaming, but they\xe2\x80\x99re aware that they\xe2\x80\x99re dreaming, and can take control of their dream. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been aware that I was dreaming before, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t recall ever having the full control I would like.<br /><br />I sometimes wonder if those occasions were truly lucid dreams or simply dreams about dreaming and being aware of it but incapable of fully controlling the dreams that I was dreaming about. Roundabout, I know, but people often dream of things they want and I want to have lucid dreams, so it makes some amount of twisted sense that I might dream about having them. I suppose they could be considered nightmares given that I\xe2\x80\x99m essentially failing to gain full control of the dreams within the dreams, but the lack of horror makes that seem less appropriate.<br /><br />Incidentally, the first thing I generally attempt when I\xe2\x80\x99m aware I\xe2\x80\x99m dreaming is flight. It annoys me how often I fail, though I thankfully rarely make such attempts from high places. Ever see that episode of <em>[[wp:Freakazoid]]</em> with Candle Jack where Freakazoid puts his hands up and tries to fly prior to his lady friend reminding him that he can\xe2\x80\x99t fly? It\xe2\x80\x99s kinda like that, but with more fruitless hopping and falling.', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2004-08-09', 'Id': 572, 'DateStatedAboveComic': '2004-08-09'}, 573: {'Commentary': 'No DVD movie style commentary yet exists for this comic.

Just about everybody sings, including the orcs. That&#39;s a world dedicated to the arts and drunken singing fun, right there.<br /><br />Given the series obsession with song and the fact that I was parodying it here, I felt I had to include at least few lines of a song. I don&#39;t think LOTR is prone to musical style singing where everybody just magically knows the words, at least not without a wizard&#39;s help, so these hobbit versions of Susan and Tedd must have sung this song together before. That ale they&#39;re drinking must be some potent stuff.<br /><br />I&#39;m sure I had some tune in mind for the song when I wrote it, or at least a simple way of singing it, but I&#39;m not certain now what it was. I do recall that some readers took issue with their declaration of a roof overhead, claiming that there aren&#39;t really roofs to hobbit homes. Should I have had them say "a hill overhead?" In any case, I could just claim some human bard wrote the darn thing. Or, you know, some guy. Given how prone people are to singing in that universe, an actual bard might be overkill.<br /><br />Justin&#39;s respect for Samwise from <em>Lord of the Rings</em> is one I share, though we would probably disagree on key aspects regarding just how "close" he was with Frodo. Once I saw the movies (again, I failed to read the books), I reached one simple conclusion: Sam is AWESOME and fully deserving of the "brave" title. I know the odds of me spoiling anything for anyone at this point in time are slim, but just in case, I&#39;ll leave it at that.', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2004-08-20', 'Id': 577, 'DateStatedAboveComic': '2004-08-20'}, 578: {'Commentary': 'No DVD movie style commentary yet exists for this comic.

An ideal gathering size for me is four or less people, myself included. Unless I\xe2\x80\x99m familiar with most everyone present, more than that is likely to make me feel uncomfortable.<br /><br />That said, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably not surprising that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been to many parties. I have been to some, however, and one in particular stands out. It was an apartment warming party where I knew about two out of the dozen people there, and I was the only one not drinking. I believe I was old enough to do so legally if I had wanted to, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t. I brought root beer that was meant as an option for everyone, though I think I\xe2\x80\x99m the only one who drank any.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was the life of the party.<br /><br />Being the only sober guy at a party, particularly a party where one hardly knows anybody, is awkward. One serves several useful functions, however, such as keeping certain people from doing REALLY stupid stuff as opposed to simply stupid stuff, and making coffee when everyone inevitably comes down from the booze high. The presence of a designated driver is also an upside to having someone sober around, and I tend to fulfill that role on new years eve.<br /><br />One thing that was interesting was this one guy who declared, prior to drinking anything, that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the idea of me not drinking when everyone else was. Later, after a beer, he told me he respected my restraint. After a second beer, he had turned against me once more, telling me I should drink. He seemed to go back and forth on his position regarding my drinking with every beer he drank. Beyond being an interesting anecdote, I consider that yet another reason to not start drinking any time soon.<br /><br />Which is not to say I condemn alcohol in general. I think it can be fine, like most things, <em>>in moderation</em>. I also believe it is best to wait until older for health reasons, as drinking too much too young can have additional long term effects. I am old enough where, supposedly, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry as much. I get addicted to things that don\xe2\x80\x99t even have naturally addictive properties to them, however, so I intend to continue not drinking.<br /><br />Anyway, as lame as it might make me seem to some people, I would much prefer a small gathering with close friends in place of a big party, alcohol present or otherwise. I\xe2\x80\x99ve recently spent a Friday night simply playing <em>Clue</em> with a couple of friends at their apartment, and I considered that a far superior evening to the party I described earlier.<br /><br />As for whether I would want to attend Grace\xe2\x80\x99s birthday party... Well, yeah, of course I would. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure who I\xe2\x80\x99d want to attend it with, but I\xe2\x80\x99d show up just for the opportunity to play with the transformation gun.', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2005-07-23', 'Id': 684, 'DateStatedAboveComic': '2005-07-23'}, 685: {'Commentary': 'No DVD movie style commentary yet exists for this comic.

It makes it a lot easier for me because, let\xe2\x80\x99s face it, names aren\xe2\x80\x99t my strong suit. Just look at what I call my comic.<br /><br />The basic idea behind Chaos\xe2\x80\x99s form in this comic is that it is in a constant state of flux, flowing from one form to the next with contradictions within itself, the only sign of a single mind the words being said. In short, Chaos\xe2\x80\x99s form is meant to be fitting of the name, and look like something out of a nightmare.<br /><br />I believe accurately animating Chaos would be one of the most difficult things one could animate. While the form is meant to look chaotic, there is also supposed to be a constant flow to it, a progression from one form to the next. There are formations within formations, singly formations that morph into multiple formations, not all parts are morphing at the same time or pace, etc. It\xe2\x80\x99d be like animating a constantly evolving crowd made up of shapeshifting goop with individual components within it while attempting to keep it expressive with recognizable but brief facial features. It would be a logistical nightmare best simplified or done with the help of a computer.<br /><br />Speaking of which, I should have cheated the form more myself just when drawing this non-animated version of it. I kept trying to keep track of the flow and what would morph into what. I think I wanted to keep it from appearing to morph too rapidly, but it was probably overkill.', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2007-05-03', 'Id': 855, 'DateStatedAboveComic': '2007-05-03'}, 856: {'Commentary': 'No DVD movie style commentary yet exists for this comic.

Check him out: <a href=/Filler/d/20071203.html>Link</a><br /><br />He originally had an eye patch and horrible scarring on his face, but I decided against that for several reasons. What\xe2\x80\x99s ironic is that I boldly declared this at the time of that filler:<br /><br />"The man with the eye patch might look a lot different in the end, but he&#39;ll still have that stylish eye patch and scarring."<br /><br />Apparently, past me is a dirty rotten stinking liar, as those are the two main things I wound up taking away from his design! Curse past me and his wacky shenanigans! First he took all the best buffalo wings and left me with the smallest ones for leftovers, and now this! For SHAME.<br /><br />Why did I remove the two things I claimed I would not change? Basically, it was out of a fear of commitment, they really aren\xe2\x80\x99t necessary, and they dragged things on. Three panels of this comic were originally devoted simply to Ellen and Grace reacting to the eye patch and scars, and while I could have had them ignore it, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t buy it. No matter how open minded and considerate one may be, there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be some sort of reaction to something like that.<br /><br />As for the commitment, if such aspects of a character is introduced and given panel time, it\xe2\x80\x99s basically a promise to address those aspects in detail later on. How and why was he injured, what is the significance to his character, etc. The principal may or may not be given adequate attention down the line to justify such things. Even if I plan to now, I could change my mind later, and my reasoning for having such traits could be accomplished in other ways that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t require such commitment.<br /><br />Basically, it boils down to <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chekhov&#39;s_gun>Chekhov\xe2\x80\x99s gun</a>.

To the point, that is why one side of the hallway is brick in this and other comics. Both Moperville North and South reflect this aspect of my high school experience.<br /><br />Grace\xe2\x80\x99s short term memory basically puts her in a position to temporarily have expert recollection of pretty much anything without making her an infinite repository of knowledge. How exactly this works and how loudly psychological experts would groan at this aspect of the story is difficult to say, but it does open several doors for Grace.<br /><br />As for the sneeze, this is something I\xe2\x80\x99ve wanted to have happen for a while now. What exactly is the significance of a sneeze that results in zapping? That will be addressed later. For now, it is enough to know that Ellen has sneezed in such a way that has significantly increased the mass of her hair and bust.

I don\xe2\x80\x99t personally keep track of my sneezes, but I know it would be odd to make it a month without sneezing at all. So either sneeze suppression is a side effect of the Dewitchery Diamond, or something else is going on here.<br /><br />Sneezing equaling transformation is something I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of being done before (particularly in anime and manga), as has sneezing equaling fire breathing, explosions, etc. I\xe2\x80\x99m curious about how this would be handled in role playing games. Would there have to be saving throws made versus sneezing every so often? What stat would you use to make the save? I\xe2\x80\x99d attempt to guess, but it\xe2\x80\x99s been so long since my failed attempts to play D&D that I\xe2\x80\x99d best just quit while I\xe2\x80\x99m vaguely ahead.<br /><br />What about in video games? Would there be a sneeze-o-meter that gradually goes up? Actually, that would link it to time, so it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make much sense. Hazards within the game would work better. You\xe2\x80\x99re making your way through a dungeon, and you figured out that you need to push the block onto the switch, but you forgot to do something about the dust and AH-CHOO!

Given the amount of information he has, I also felt that simply overhearing people by accident would not cut it, and therefore had him intentionally listening in on people to gather the information.<br /><br />I feel eavesdropping as a paranoid habit resulting from being outted (revealed as a homosexual) is realistic, as could many, many other triggers. The main ingredient, after all, is concern over what others might be saying about one\xe2\x80\x99s self. This is NOT meant to suggest that being attracted to the same sex somehow means that same person is going to be an eavesdropper.<br /><br />Knowing in advance that Justin would be admitting to eavesdropping, I had Elliot claim to not be eavesdropping three comics earlier while talking with Tedd. I like little parallels like that and include them when able. It also could make one wonder whether Justin is simply being more honest about his actions than Elliot.<br /><br />Nanase was originally going to do a spit take in the last panel, but I considered it too gross and didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to deal with the aftermath of spat out milk getting all over the table, their lunches, and most likely Justin.

I really should have had something more substantial, as I was often way too hungry, and that makes me really irritable. As such, I\xe2\x80\x98m happy she has the bag of nuts.<br />[*]Ellen has a plain hamburger, just the meat and the bun. If I eat a hamburger, that\xe2\x80\x98s likely how I\xe2\x80\x98m going to do it.[/list]<br /><br />And finally, the hidden gag: with the exception of the milk she is obviously drinking, Nanase has apparently finished her entire lunch by the last panel.', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2008-04-28', 'Id': 913, 'DateStatedAboveComic': '2008-04-28'}, 914: {'Commentary': 'Ok, this commentary is so long, I&#39;m actually going to divide it up into sections with subtitles. Seriously; it&#39;s over two pages at font size 10 when pasted into a word document, and that&#39;s not counting this intro.<br /><br /><strong>They Want to Believe</strong><br /><br />So basically, the entire premise of what&#39;s going on here is that people often see what they want to see, and what they want to see, thanks to some popular movie, is Ellen as a lesbian and Grace as her na\xc3\xafve, unaware partner.<br /><br />As a fan of the TV show <em>[[wp:Mythbusters]]</em>, I am well aware of the phenomenon of people wanting something to be true to the point of skewing perception and logic in order to believe it. On the show, they often address myths that exist simply due to people wanting them to be true in spite of those myths having no basis in reality. They even have to go back and address myths they\xe2\x80\x99ve already proven false simply due to the fans who aren\xe2\x80\x99t willing to give up on the myths they\xe2\x80\x99ve grown to love.<br /><br />Of course, the fans sometimes have good points when requesting myth revisits, but I\xe2\x80\x99m specifically talking about the more outlandish myths here.<br /><br />Another point? Space aliens. People will see something odd, and instead of looking for a down-to-earth explanation, many will jump to the alien conclusion without solid evidence. They will ignore every piece of evidence other than the evidence that supports what they want to believe. I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying for certain that there aren\xe2\x80\x99t space aliens out there, but just because we can\xe2\x80\x99t explain something doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that aliens are behind it. By that logic, we could blame anything unknown on extraterrestrials.<br /><br />Another example comes from a special I saw on El Chupacabra (and yes, it was on <em>[[wp:Discovery Channel]]</em>). A scientist sent his best evidence, some fur he had collected from a supposed Chupacabra attack, to be analyzed. He specifically said that if the results revealed the fur to be from a known animal, he would consider it conclusive evidence that there is no such thing as El Chupacabra. The results of the fur analysis? Dog fur. The scientist, in spite of his earlier assertion, did not stop his search for El Chupacabra. Much like Mulder, the man wants to believe.<br /><br />Wait, did I just compare lesbians to space aliens and El Chupacabra? I guess I did. That\xe2\x80\x99s gotta be worth a GLAAD award, or at least some sort of letter from them. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the response can only be good.<br /><br /><strong>The Rumor</strong><br /><br />From a story perspective, I believe it creates a much more complicated situation for Ellen to be accused of being gay without technically including Grace. Yes, Grace is involved, but only Ellen is being given the actual label of being a lesbian, and given that Ellen agreed to be "in the closet" with Nanase, it is a bit of a problem. It also means the people who buy into the rumor don\xe2\x80\x99t technically see her as being "with" Grace, opening up the very real possibility of her being with someone else, such as, perhaps, the person she sits next to every day at lunch?<br /><br />For the record, I don\xe2\x80\x99t approve of actually doing something like this (tricking a na\xc3\xafve person into risqu\xc3\xa9 and/or sexual behavior) in real life. I find this highly amusing in a fantasy setting, but I would find this taking advantage of a na\xc3\xafve person to be horribly disturbing and wrong in real life. Remember: this is fantasy. This is all well and good here, but lets keep it on paper, ok? Or digital, because this isn\xe2\x80\x99t on paper... though it will probably be in print eventually... whatever! The point is, don\xe2\x80\x99t do this sort of thing in real life.<br /><br /><strong>Nanase&#39;s Fantasy</strong><br /><br />The Ellen and Grace doppelgangers within Nanase\xe2\x80\x99s imagination are slightly changed physically from the real Ellen and Grace. The obvious differences are that Ellen has longer hair and both are dressed in more revealing outfits. What might be less clear is that Nanase has given the fantasy version of Grace Ellen\xe2\x80\x98s figure.<br /><br />Within Nanase\xe2\x80\x99s imagination in panel four, the book title is "How to Kiss: Practice W/Friends", with Ellen herself as the credited author. For those who are perhaps a little confused by this, "W/Friends" should read as "With Friends". Doppelganger Grace is also wearing a sort of collar, a design relatively common outside of EGS continuity, with an E for "Ellen" on it. Given the supposed na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9 of this Grace doppelganger, she likely does not understand the implication.<br /><br />Panel five was originally more explicit, as there was no indication that these Ellen and Grace doppelgangers were wearing anything at all. They wound up with clothes due to nudity under those circumstances suggesting more than I wanted, which is simply the two of them sleeping together (literally). In addition, the sixth panel is supposed to be the most explicit and shocking one, and having them naked in bed the panel before steps on the toes of that and is just less funny and more explicit in general.<br /><br />Speaking of panel sixth, in case the comic title is not enough, allow me to break it down further. The translation of what Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s doppelganger is saying would roughly equate to "we\xe2\x80\x99re low on time, and we both need to shower, but there\xe2\x80\x99s only one shower and two of us!". Doppelganger Grace, of course, has figured out a clever solution to this problem, which is likely the same conclusion doppelganger Ellen was hoping for.<br /><br />As much as I enjoy having characters speak with simple symbols, it does create the occasional need for explanation. I hope that, for the most part, people are able to comprehend it enough prior to my explaining to at least find it amusing.<br /><br /><strong>The Movie Aspects</strong><br /><br />The logical conclusion to reach from the title <em>"American Cake"</em> is that I am parodying the <em>[[wp:American Pie (film)|American Pie]]</em> movies. In a way, I am, but only the title. There is a real movie that inspired this fake one that has nothing to do with <em>American Pie</em>, though it did include characters as wholesome as apple pie. Can you guess what rowdy movie actually had a running gag of a similar nature within it?<br /><br />If you guessed <em>[[wp:The Brady Bunch Movie]]</em>, you are correct.<br /><br />For those who don\xe2\x80\x99t know, <em>The Brady Bunch Movie</em> essentially had the characters from <em>The Brady Bunch</em> sitcom living in the nineties, but unchanged from the 70s sitcom. Theses wholesome, unrealistic characters placed in a far more realistic and harsh environment than their sitcom roots effectively made them the most na\xc3\xafve people anywhere, ever.<br /><br />Within the plot, one of the Brady girls, Marcia, had a friend who was clearly a lesbian who wanted some Brady action, but of course Marcia was completely unaware. At one point, there was even a sleep over that had them sharing the same bed while Marcia remained clueless (which inspired panel five). While I am not a huge fan of the movie as a whole, this aspect of it had an impact on me, and was also part of the inspiration for Amanda\xe2\x80\x99s roommate, Lisa.<br /><br />So then why, if there exists an actual movie that is already seemingly perfect for getting people to think about this sort of thing, did I make up a fictional movie? Well, first of all, the idea is that this movie is widely popular with teenagers, successful, and somewhat recent. <em>The Brady Bunch Movie</em> was released in early 1995, and were it used as a reference, it would become more and more obscure and confusing a reference as the years go by, and it would be odd for the student body to latch onto it.<br /><br />Secondly, I don\xe2\x80\x99t own and can\xe2\x80\x99t control <em>The Brady Bunch Movie</em>. It should be ok for me to simply make reference to it, but it would severely limits how I could use it. By making it a fictional movie that parodies both <em>The Brady Bunch Movie</em> and <em>American Pie</em>, and really any other pop culture movie that fits the basic formula, it opens the door to do more with it. For example, what if I come up with a joke or story point that calls for a sequel? The amount of freedom is far greater than if I had referenced an actual film.<br /><br />The reason the title of the movie is a parody of <em>American Pie</em> is the popularity of those movies (or at least what they once had) and them being teen-related comedies. It just seemed like a natural fit, even more natural than the movie that actually inspired the scenario.', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2008-04-30', 'Id': 914, 'DateStatedAboveComic': '2008-04-30'}, 915: {'Commentary': 'Another long one!

Which, technically, is true, but it&#39;s still deception, hiding, and sneaking around. (PS - Yay Jeremy!)<br /><br />Secondly, that "who is looking at me" spell is all about keeping tabs on who is watching you. Use of the spell itself isn&#39;t necessarily sneaking around, but if using it makes her feel exposed to the point of almost feeling naked, well there&#39;s your feeling the need to hide right there.<br /><br />Thirdly, the color clone magic isn&#39;t necessarily sneaking around or deception unless someone uses it for such things, but she&#39;s hiding in the bathroom while using it!<br /><br />All of these spells could be used in ways that wouldn&#39;t count as hiding or sneaking, but that&#39;s pretty much what Nanase has spent the entire day doing. In her mad dash to obtain new spells that won&#39;t make her feel like a hiding sneak, she has done nothing but hide and sneak while using her magic.<br /><br />All the same, however, it appears her messing up so badly has had results she can&#39;t help but find cool. You&#39;ll get the chance to decide whether you agree a bit later on.<br /><br /><strong>Fantasies and Flashbacks</strong><br /><br />Half the comics in the past two weeks have had fantasies or flashbacks in them. While one of my goals is to have more such sequences where appropriate, I think this is a much higher concentration than will be the norm.<br /><br />I tend to enjoy writing and drawing fantasies and flashbacks. The fantasies I like because it allows me the freedom to take the story places it can&#39;t normally go without jumping a great many sharks, and I like both because they allow for quick jokes with very little set up.<br /><br />That said, I prefer fantasies and flashbacks that are somehow relevant to the story being told. I like <em>[[wp:Family Guy]]</em>, but there are many, many times when it has fantasies and/or flashbacks that don&#39;t have any relation to anything and can be more of a rude interruption of the actual plot than a humorous excursion.<br /><br />This would probably infuriate Seth Macfarlane, creator of <em>Family Guy</em>, but I think <em>[[wp:Scrubs]]</em> does it best.

If Susan had a full stomach during this comic, she may very well have had the energy to put up a fight in the face of over half the feminist club leaving.<br /><br />Admittedly, it wouldn&#39;t have accomplished anything and would have extended this scene to possibly two or more comics and wouldn&#39;t have effectively shown how fatigued Susan is fast becoming, but that&#39;s besides the point. EAT YOUR LUNCHES!<br /><br />In case it wasn&#39;t obvious, the basic idea here is that only Susan, Sarah and Catalina actually really cared about the club, and that Susan was likely deluding herself thinking that these four would be willing to go out on a limb to try and make a difference. This is a definite blow to both Susan&#39;s will to fight and her self esteem, but there&#39;s more to it than even that. What more is there, exactly? Next comic.<br /><br />The non-Sarah blonde in this comic is dressed in a style reminiscent of Britney Spears way back when the most disturbing things about her were her status as jailbait and popularizing the baring of midriffs, the midriff baring being very much a double-edged sword on more levels than I could possibly hope or want to address here. Whether she has merely gotten away with this by luck or has been granted special permission, as did Sarah with her beret, is unclear, but let&#39;s hope it\xe2\x80\x99s the former. If it is the latter, we can at least take comfort in the fact that I decided to have her wear a black shirt underneath her white one.<br /><br />This outfit choice was done to further emphasize that this girl was out of place in a feminist&#39;s club. Granted, being a feminist does not automatically mean one will not expose their belly button (as Susan used to for whatever reason), nor does the role instantly demand a great deal of modesty, but the point with THIS specific girl is that she has no issues flaunting her stuff and will gladly portray herself as a sex object. Granted, nothing that she says or does in this comic explicitly establishes that, but I&#39;m counting on all of you to unfairly judge her based on this one brief encounter.<br /><br />You should be ashamed of yourselves.<br /><br />Speaking of the alien in the last panel, even though we clearly weren\xe2\x80\x99t, this little space guy\xe2\x80\x99s hearing Catalina\xe2\x80\x99s cry of outrage is obviously an exaggeration and not actually happening. Arguments about how Uryuoms travel in space, and whether they use saucers, should NOT use this page as a reference. I\xe2\x80\x99m aware this may sound presumptuous, but I have actually witnessed these debates already. I can only hope those nerdy enough to debate Uryuom space travel are ALSO nerdy enough to read this commentary.<br /><br />Incidentally, even before I ever drew him in any pose, I for some reason kept envisioning that Uryuom in the last panel fishing. No water, no terrain to speak of. Just fishing. Somehow. In space. I chose not to go through with having him fishing because I could not explain why, or even how, he would be fishing, and I felt it would be a source of unnecessary confusion in what should be a fairly obvious joke.<br /><br />I also suspect that the likely reason it\xe2\x80\x99s stuck in my mind is because someone else did it before me. I cannot recall such an instance, but the whole "cut to a shot of the Earth and show a startled alien" has been done many times before I got to it, and it is possible that somewhere out there is an image already in existence of an alien inexplicably fishing in space while someone shouts from the earth.<br /><br />The "I\xe2\x80\x99m remembering something I\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen" excuse, of course, is much more preferable than the other explanation, which is simply that I\xe2\x80\x99m insane.

She&#39;s technically correct about setting up tables and flyers if one goes strictly by the school guidelines, but it&#39;s realistic that the school just wouldn&#39;t care.

There are a few reasons for this, but the big one is that Ellen&#39;s first thoughts when seeing a clone spell would naturally not be about how cool it is or ways to use it for fun. No, they would more naturally be along the lines of "oh my God", "this is disturbingly close to home", "is this clone like me?", etc.<br /><br />Fact of the matter is, if Nanase had not made it almost immediately clear that Fox is of a very different nature from Ellen, this comic would have quickly spiraled into an angst-filled dramatic moment.<br /><br />So, yeah, thank goodness Nanase cleared that up as fast as she did!', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2008-06-27', 'Id': 938, 'DateStatedAboveComic': '2008-06-27'}, 939: {'Commentary': '[[2007-06-05|Justin previously brought up the same point]] about not hiding to get non-hiding spells, but Nanase was too busy casting a spell at the time in an effort to get new magic to notice.<br /><br />I&#39;m not really happy with panel six of this comic. Yes, it gets the point across, but I wish I had done it in such a way that didn&#39;t require narration. In fact, it originally DIDN&#39;T have narration, but then it occurred to me that, without the narration, it gave the impression that Raven had just mysteriously appeared in the ladies&#39; room. I would have done more to fix the panel, but I came to realize my dissatisfaction really late in the production process, and I&#39;m not certain I want to devote time to making that one panel niftier at the expense of future comic production.<br /><br />I originally figured I would have this particular restroom located close to the lockers, but I realized it made more sense for them to go off to a more secluded restroom for showing Ellen Nanase&#39;s magic. It&#39;s not really all that important, but I consider it worth noting that the previous scene didn&#39;t occur in a restroom where they were likely to be walked in on.

There are plenty of odd and disturbing things I&#39;d be willing to put in them, such as the sort of things that make shippers glee with delight, but there is a line and this comic almost crossed it.<br /><br />I really liked the visual of Raven as a pimp. I don&#39;t approve of pimping or prostitution in general, but I find the "stereotypical pimp" look hilarious. However, that on its own doesn&#39;t really fit the "dirty old man" fantasy. Yes, there can be, and sadly probably are, dirty old men who are pimps, but that&#39;s not what I was going for here.<br /><br />To make the visual work for the context, there needed to be girls included, which was almost a deal breaker. The idea of drawing Ellen and Nanase as hookers, even in a fantasy sequence, sickened me. I almost dropped the "Pimp Raven" panel altogether when I realized I could add a verbal joke to the visual that makes it clear that they&#39;re not hookers. This version remains disturbing, but it&#39;s not so bad that I have a problem showing it as a fantasy sequence.<br /><br />Granted, one could argue that posing in such a manner for a better grade is a form of prostitution, but that&#39;s arguing semantics.

With this comic, if I put something like that in, people are going to wonder why it&#39;s there and assume there&#39;s a reason behind it. Giving Sarah sunglasses while inside without explaining why she&#39;s wearing them would be like putting a 500 pound Gorilla in the comic without explanation and expect nobody to speculate about it.<br /><br />As much as I like using color for the characters in EGS, I still fret over what colors to use for backgrounds. I originally had an off-white color for the background in an attempt at what I remembered my own high school walls being like, but it just didn&#39;t look good in the comic. I find myself torn between what would be appropriate for the location in real life and what would look good in the comic. Another sign that I need more practice.<br /><br />Of course, another factor is these cursed school uniforms. Now that the comic&#39;s in color, the black and white uniforms make any and every other color choice stand out a lot more. At South, where they dress in every color of the rainbow, subdued backgrounds seem to work ok, as the characters add plenty of color to the panels. At North, however, having saturated backgrounds has become somewhat of a must.<br /><br />Do me a favor: if the walls of some locations change colors later on, just assume artistic license, because I can pretty much guarantee there will be inexplicable changes to recurring locales as I get better with color.

There was no way this gag wasn&#39;t happening.<br /><br />Although, I think this comic is significant as the first story comic to actually make mention of Liz&#39;s name.

The game they&#39;re playing is an actual playable game that I invented in High School for pretty much the same reason Tedd said, except in my case it was for a study hall period. As with most card games, it is ideally played from opposite sides of the table; Elliot and Tedd are positioned as they are simply for artistic convenience.<br /><br />I&#39;ve posted the <a href=http://www.egscomics.com/sumo.page>rules for the game</a>, along with some sample images.

Anyway, as far as this mystery is concerned, noting the hue differences between the first two panels and the third may be worth doing.<br /><br />That extra with the brown hair has been in the comic several times now, enough to have earned the title of minor character. I suppose any extra that speeks or does something of significance could logically be upgraded from simple extra to minor character, and this is [[2007-08-21|the guy who announced to everyone]] that Susan was doing something about the uniforms, so he definitely qualifies. The guy who is with him does as well, though this is his first appearance.

It&#39;s also fun, at least I think it is, to keep track of who has witnessed what, and to consider what awkward moments could result from it.<br /><br />Another thing this comic seems to have a lot of these days is bathrooms. I used to find it odd that they spent so much time in the unisex bathroom in [[wp:Ally McBeal]], and now just about every other scene in this comic includes a bathroom.

I had to do much hunting, and really all I was looking for was something similar to my old high school&#39;s auditorium. The layout and general position of this auditorium in the school is based on my own high school experience, which isn&#39;t meant to be a comment on my old school.

I enjoy it when transformed characters unintentionally do things they wouldn&#39;t normally do without even really being aware of it, such as that cute pose. I am well aware that plenty of women would not assume that pose, but part of the fun of having gender transformations in a comedy is playing with such changes in behavior and how they fit with our expectations of gender behavior.

The batter stance was also difficult, as almost every reference I found on Google showed the batter&#39;s chest, and I needed references from the back.

One of the key reasons for this is that action often calls for lots of panels, and there often aren&#39;t more panels per page for the fights. For online comics that update gradually, this can be brutal.<br /><br />And that&#39;s why this comic is twelve frickin&#39; panels long. I could have made it nine, but I feel the current last panel is a much more satisfying panel to end on. It&#39;s as much a cliffhanger as panel nine would have been, but it has the Bloodgrem right on top of Elliot, which means the next comic doesn&#39;t have to deal with that buildup, and the story can move along faster.<br /><br />Truth be told, this comic could have benefitted from a thirteenth panel, as the broken broom was clearly flipped at some point between panels five and seven. The splintered end would be down, otherwise. Then again, I&#39;ve been told the number thirteen is unlucky, and this comic took a ridiculously long time to make as it was.

There&#39;s really no other conclusion for him to jump to at this point, regardless of his claim about not wanting to jump to them.<br /><br />While I originally saw this as a bad thing, I now see it as an opportunity to briefly address certain matters regarding Lord Tedd, and to add to a small running gag that will be coming up later regarding how unnecessarily complicated this story could get and how it must be avoided. Additionally, this makes this story arc parallel the first <em>[[2002-05-26|Sister]]</em> even more now. Goo, Lord Tedd, jumping to conclusions... it feels more like a sequel to me now than it would without bringing those things up.<br /><br />While much of EGS combat has no real basis on actual martial arts, the first few panels of this comic does. I used to study <em>[[wp:Hapkido]]</em>, and while I did not get far enough along in it to deal with weaponry, I witnessed many demonstrations of one person using a short stick to defend against a much larger one.<br /><br />The disarming move used in panel three is accurate to a point, as the actual disarming move would have Elliot pushing back against his opponent. I wanted to put some distance between Elliot and the Bloodgrem, so I had him kick the monster instead. I was taught that Hapkido is generally about ending the fight without anybody, including the aggressor, really getting hurt. This modified version is somewhat contrary to the philosophy of Hapkido, but that remains the inspiration for the move. It&#39;s also why Elliot wound up with a screwdriver, as a relatively large, strong steel screwdriver would function as an adequate analog for a small, thick stick.<br /><br />I have the feeling the modified version of the actual move wouldn&#39;t work nearly as well in real life. Then again, most people would be grabbing the weapon from a grounded human sized adversary and not a midair monster monkey, so who knows.', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2008-08-01', 'Id': 953, 'DateStatedAboveComic': '2008-08-01'}, 954: {'Commentary': 'Ah, Aura vision... it&#39;s fun to imagine different ways to see the world.

His role is to have to deal with Tony and apologize for him all the time; he deserves a name AND a medal! As for why he&#39;s so concerned with political correctness, there are two reasons.<br /><br />First, the meta reason: I like to make jokes about trying too hard to be politically correct. The character reason: he&#39;s friends with Tony, and feels like he has to make an extra effort to maintain his own political correctness because of it. He also feels the need to apologize for Tony.<br /><br />Based on the character reasons, I am working under the assumption that these two have been friends for a long time. I doubt they would have met in high school and became friends then, but if they&#39;ve known each other for years and years? Two people can grow apart in many, many ways while still remaining friends while attending school.

The situations I speak of are when I&#39;ve felt obligated to help someone I didn&#39;t particularly like. I&#39;m not talking obligated due to a job or anything, just personal "I&#39;m going to feel guilty all day if I don&#39;t help" sort of thing.<br /><br />There was one time in particular when I angrily gave lunch money to someone I was annoyed with when they forgot their wallet. They didn&#39;t ask for money, and were somewhat confused as to why I was being so angrily generous, but they got some food out of it so they weren&#39;t really in much of a position to complain about my mysterious "how DARE you make me feel empathy towards you" rage.', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2008-08-06', 'Id': 955, 'DateStatedAboveComic': '2008-08-06'}, 956: {'Commentary': 'The title is a reference to <em>[[wp:Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Trials and Tribulations]]</em>.<br /><br />I&#39;m somewhat saddened by the lack of Matt Cohen in this page. I had originally wanted to have a brief three panel sequence with Elliot momentarily postponed from reaching the table by Matt offering him a pamphlet, and as such, this comic would have originally ended with Susan&#39;s question in what is now panel five. Unfortunately, as I wrote the scripts beyond this page, I found that the whole thing just had a horrible cascade effect of butchering the timing of future comics, so it was cut.<br /><br />This comic was relatively easy to draw, as it&#39;s mostly just characters I frequently draw standing around talking with simple camera angles. Is it odd that I still refer to them as "camera angels" when there&#39;s no camera involved? Anyway, this made it very easy to sketch, but mind numbing to ink. It&#39;s already somewhat tedious to go over what one has already drawn, but when the characters aren&#39;t moving much, it&#39;s even more so. Elliot&#39;s face in panel six, however, was definitely fun to both sketch and ink.<br /><br />Many people both e-mailed me and posted in the forums about how stupid Elliot has been acting by not going right to his friends, and while I defend Elliot&#39;s actions from an emotional standpoint, this comic shows just how logically correct everyone was. If you specifically said he should talk to Susan, bravo, though it isn&#39;t entirely clear yet why this would be so obvious to Susan. I don&#39;t want to say too much, but there&#39;s a big, huge fat clue as to why towards the end of the first <em>Sister</em> story arc.<br /><br />Also, Sarah rubbed Elliot&#39;s tummy.

For now, I&#39;m going to proceed under the assumption that it&#39;s okay to use.<br /><br />We&#39;ve reached the point in the story where technical matters need to be explained, which means dreaded exposition. The strategy this time around is somewhat different and hopefully more entertaining from previous such lengthy explanations in EGS, but I won&#39;t get into the specifics of exactly how until we&#39;re further into it.<br /><br />One thing that&#39;s bound to come up is the question "why aren&#39;t they whispering?" One of the general jokes I have at Moperville North (MNHS) is that they discuss all these strange things without making much or any effort to conceal it, but the worst that ever happens is they get strange looks. This would also be a joke at Moperville South (MSHS), but I prefer to have them whisper when it comes to Nanase being a lesbian to emphasize the importance of it being kept a secret.<br /><br />This comic introduces possibly the third reason why this Story Arc has the subtitle "awakenings". There are probably more if one wants to try to figure out the rationales, but the ones I&#39;m thinking of are the statue, Elliot waking up as a woman, and now "awakened" to using magic.<br /><br />And since I suspect some of you are reading this commentary entirely because of the last panel, here&#39;s the explanation: a lot of girls seem to scream excitedly as a sign of happiness. I find this odd and sometimes painful, hence that dude with the greenish hairlooking rather distressed.<br /><br />Okay, okay: Lisa and Amanda are high school students here for no reason other than their screaming during [[2005-05-23|the intro to the party arc]].

Well, I would say a time gap between EGS and Germahn Labs, but a comic in Painted Black [[2003-12-31|suggests that Amanda]] was working for Dr. Germahn a few years earlier, so it really doesn&#39;t make sense.

I wound up figuring that if the auditorium worked once as a place of privacy, it could work again, and Elliot could reasonably want to check out the general area where he first encountered the Bloodgrem again.<br /><br />Hooray for Lavender, Mr. Verres&#39;s uryuom assistant! An uryuom assistant who has CLEARLY made use of one or more cosmetic morphing devices (CMDs) in her day. I believe her skin would normally be the color that her hair is here, but she&#39;s attempting to look close to human, and Uryuoms can shift their coloring any which way they please even without the help of CMDs.

Looking at that page, it&#39;s also clear that I&#39;ve changed the design of Verres&#39;s office, or that he simply wasn&#39;t in his office in that previous page. I attempted to include a joke in the first panel about how it was his new office, or newly refurbished, or whatever.

One reason is simply that I can bring those monsters back again even if they get brutally taken out, and another is that it allows for more intense, yet relatively lighthearted, combat when the situation calls for it.

I say "poor Elliot" because he&#39;s confused, possibly a little scared, and just wants some clear answers.<br /><br />Much like many of the readers at this point. We already have a bunch of answers, actually; they just have yet to be neatly summarized within the comic itself. Current speculation by characters within the comic suggests that Elliot and Ellen awakened and become magic users after Elliot touched the diamond, but nobody realized it and assumed they simply got limited new powers. They&#39;ve reached a point where they&#39;re being forced to use their magic and Elliot did something with magic that he wouldn&#39;t have been able to if he hadn&#39;t awakened but is not a reflection of who he is, which is now making it clear to others who know about this stuff that it happened. There&#39;s some other stuff, too, but that&#39;s pretty much what we have regarding Elliot transforming so far.<br /><br />Which is basically how I&#39;m going about this. The information is gradually given as other things happen and the story progresses with a quick, neat summary afterwords to satisfy anyone who has had trouble following it (and to provide an easy place to link to instead of a maze of links to sort out ze puzzle). I&#39;m doing it this way in part because all this information needs to get out anyway, but I don&#39;t want to have a single scene of nothing but exposition. That gets too wordy, uninteresting, and I figure there&#39;s a good chance that important details would be forgotten beneath a wave of textbook style wordiness.

For example, this comic when Elliot says "I&#39;m not--." In this case, Elliot was going to point out that he&#39;s not asleep, but what if it wasn&#39;t so obvious? What if I had only written the start of a sentence and, knowing he was going to get cut off, didn&#39;t care or think about how it would have ended? Consider that yourself the next time that happens in something you&#39;re reading or listening to and ask yourself whether you believe there was an actual end to the start of whatever sentence just just got interrupted.

This also means we&#39;re not likely to hear a "this is complicated enough as it is" joke for a while after the last comic.<br /><br />Speaking of the rule of three, one problem I run into is that I generally wind up with four characters per scene during school. This can work, of course, but there are times when characters wind up not getting to do much. Justin, for example, is little more than a prop in this page there for continuity&#39;s sake. He&#39;ll get to say stuff before this scene is over (unless I do yet another rewrite), but for this page, my apologies to Justin fans.<br /><br />Grace doesn&#39;t have much to do on this page either, as Ellen didn&#39;t really need her to say she sneezed and zapped herself, but I like it better with Grace blurting it out. Also, I like that she has no respect for the fourth wall. Characters aren&#39;t supposed to interact with the ellipses they&#39;re popping out of during such visuals, but Grace is treating it as though she&#39;s popping out of a hole in time and space, and she points at the flashback! Breaking the fourth wall would be unforgivable if she verbally acknowledged it, but I guess she can be forgiven while within a panel with rounded borders.<br /><br /><strong>Panel Three</strong><br /><br />I don&#39;t like that there isn&#39;t much of a background beyond a burst and gradient in panel three, but it&#39;s a casualty of time VS reward, and the background there would have been much to complicated for too little reward to justify it. What I really should have done was a different angle, but that&#39;s a realization that came too little, too late. I also think that Ellen looks a little weird in this panel... wow, I&#39;m really criticizing myself in this commentary, aren&#39;t I?<br /><br />One thing I DO like about panel three is the explanation as to why she zapped herself already today. For one thing, it&#39;s explanation that isn&#39;t in and of itself dirty, as opposed to the sort of joke I might&#39;ve done with Tedd in the same situation. It&#39;s also left to the imagination, which means the exact circumstances and how it went are left up to the reader.<br /><br />Ellen zapping herself to tease Elliot also establishes something that I don&#39;t think has really been brought up in this arc yet, which is the simple fact that Ellen loves to poke fun at, and generally mess with, Elliot. While she does confide in and care for Elliot, she gets immense satisfaction from mocking him, and absolutely loves it when Elliot is a girl and feeling awkward. Ellen would love a picture of female Elliot in a dress as depicted in panel five... which, I would hope, explains her laughter in the last panel.<br /><br /><strong>Chibi Three</strong><br /><br />Speaking of panel five, well... I love that panel. I didn&#39;t draw Nanase&#39;s left hand because I knew it would just get covered up, but I might have to finish that drawing so I can make a wallpaper out of it. At the very least, I will be making a wallpaper of that panel sans "Hot for Teacher" Nanase with just the chibi diagram.<br /><br />Panel five is the sort of fantasy sequence I love to do in EGS. It doesn&#39;t interrupt the dialogue and the characters don&#39;t acknowledge it, but it&#39;s a fun visual that shakes things up during a long dialogue sequence. It reminds me of when [[2003-07-10|Nanase was describing her web of lies]] back during Night Out, which is also a sequence I love. I need to find more places to put in stuff like this. I was deprived of doing so for the last several weeks of comics, so I&#39;m looking forward to it being more of an option.<br /><br /><strong>Palette Three?</strong><br /><br />Nanase&#39;s color palette was adjusted as of this page to make her skin darker and her hair lighter. The hues are the same, but I felt it was simply wrong for Nanase&#39;s skin to be so light, and the hair just seemed overly dark to me. I believe I made Nanase&#39;s skin light because she&#39;s related to Tedd, but that wasn&#39;t the right thing to do as the official reason Tedd has light skin is the same reason Susan has light skin: he doesn&#39;t get outside much. He&#39;s got the "pale nerd" thing going for him. Nanase&#39;s look isn&#39;t meant to imply anything like that, so I consider the palette adjustment more of a correction than an adjustment.<br /><br />Incidentally, YES, that least paragraph does suggest that alternate versions of Tedd and Susan should logically have slightly darker skin if they go outside more. Should Susan ever meet one of her alternates, it will be tempting to give them a significant tan... though I probably won&#39;t, as I doubt even Susan&#39;s alternates are the tanning types regardless of whether they get outside more.', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2008-09-03', 'Id': 963, 'DateStatedAboveComic': '2008-09-03'}, 964: {'Commentary': 'Once again, Grace finds a way to make a statement in an odd way. My favorite of these remains "corn that isn&#39;t corn" in reference to the term "corny."<br /><br />I think it&#39;s perfectly understandable for Ellen to find Elliot&#39;s situation amusing. Given her own situation, I&#39;d actually find it understandable if she was a bit more malicious about it, too. As things stand, she considers it acceptable to find it amusing in part because it&#39;s not something that Elliot will be stuck with forever, and that&#39;s a consideration many people in her place wouldn&#39;t make.<br /><br />There was a significant gap in production between the previous comic and this one for several reasons, so if there appears to be a bit of a jump in the artwork, that&#39;s because there is. In addition to rethinking how I draw some of the characters hair and heavier line thickness, this was the first comic in a long time that I sketched off of the computer on actual paper.<br /><br />While I believe sketching off the computer results in mostly better drawings, I made a mistake with this one in that I sketched it at 100% print size. It is normally wise to draw larger than the final print version, but I figured I could get away with not doing so and use less paper given that I&#39;d be going over it on the computer anyway.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this resulted in lower quality sketches, which made digital inking more difficult and even required some additional computer sketching just to make sense of what I&#39;d drawn. The first panel, Justin&#39;s arms in panel three and Ellen&#39;s left hand in panel four all had to be resketched digitally prior to inking, as did pretty much all of Justin in panel six.<br /><br />The comics to follow this one are being sketched at a larger size and are much cleaner while still being faster and better looking than sketched on the computer. Many background elements will likely remain 95% digital with that 5% being the perspective established in pencil so the characters don&#39;t seem out of place.', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2008-11-04', 'Id': 964, 'DateStatedAboveComic': '2008-11-04'}, 965: {'Commentary': 'For anyone having trouble reading the sign: "Moperville South High School - Have fun and learn.

That would indeed be true if I was using my old method of shading.<br /><br />The old method basically involved me carefully drawing out guidelines of where to add shadow, then using a fill tool to fill areas with darker versions of the respective colors. Now I\xe2\x80\x99m just drawing with a brush tool on a separate layer with black set at a transparency and using the fill tool on larger blocks of shadow. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take that long to do, and it actually makes coloring easier. Adding shadows makes it simple to add contrast, meaning similar colors are less of an issue and there\xe2\x80\x99s less need to mess with gradients. I think this is the first comic in a long time to not have a single gradient in it.<br /><br />The reason I went mad and added shadows is because the flat colors were driving me crazy. The feel I was getting from them was simply not what I wanted, particularly given some of the upcoming scenes. While EGS is primarily comedic, there are some very serious moments on the horizon, and they simply will not work without some shadow effects.<br /><br />In the interest of comedy and keeping things light hearted where possible, however, I intend to keep the shadows mostly subtle. The lighting is somewhat stronger in this scene due to it being outside and the sun up high and to the West, so there are more shadows being cast. Most scenes are more well lit and indoors, so while the shadows might be as dark as here, there should be less of them.', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2008-11-06', 'Id': 965, 'DateStatedAboveComic': '2008-11-06'}, 966: {'Commentary': 'If the party story arc was chronologically further back, I would have added some furniture and possibly a painting to the first panel. Given how recently that was, however, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to drastically redecorate the Verres household just yet. I figure that the bean bag and rug are acceptable additions.<br /><br />Speaking of decoration, where\xe2\x80\x99s Jeremy? He\xe2\x80\x99s a perfect prop for a scene such as this. I suspect I was too distracted by figuring out the layout for this scene and the perspective in panel one that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think to include our fuzzy little friend. Not that he\xe2\x80\x99d stick around once the Magic Analysis wand was turned on, but he could\xe2\x80\x99ve sat there and looked cute in the first panel.<br /><br />You know what? Scratch that. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t forget Jeremy; I mercifully had him napping upstairs and away from the sound of the wand. Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s the ticket!<br /><br />It\xe2\x80\x99s been a while since Sarah has had her hair down like this. The only difference is that she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t combed it back behind her ears, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not like she mysteriously got a hair cut between school and going to Tedd\xe2\x80\x99s house. My excuse is that she wore the beret all day and was tired of having her hair resting up against her ears. From a design standpoint, I just wanted to change things up a bit.<br /><br />I originally envisioned Grace\xe2\x80\x99s eyes being closed in panel five, a sort of look of mature patience when dealing with someone less mature who is upset. While I liked the look, however, it was somewhat out of character for Grace to the point of making it unclear as to why her eyes were closed. I could have made her say "there there" to drive the point home, but that would also be out of character, and would drag out the final punch line.<br /><br />Tedd\xe2\x80\x99s description of what the wand sounded like used to be more elaborate with additional adjectives and a mention of space marines. I think it works better after the edit. If this was 2002, he probably would have had a second paragraph describing his dislike of the sound.<br /><br />I hope that it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that the lighting effects in panel two are dramatic license and not real. I have to be careful in a fantasy comic such as this, but given that the light is normal in panels three and six, I would like to think that it\xe2\x80\x99s apparent that only the sound is not exaggerated.<br /><br />I\xe2\x80\x99m still figuring out the finer points of shading in this comic. I strategically used less pure black shadows, but there are places where I should\xe2\x80\x99ve kept more. Some of the darker colors have less natural contrast with the shadows, such as Grace and Elliot/Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s hair, and I think those areas should have more of those maximum contrast black shadows. Not a whole lot more, but enough for boosted contrast.

In truth, however, this is more of a confirmation than a [[wp:retcon]]. Okay, to be fair, a retcon did take place. It\xe2\x80\x99s just that it was back in 2002 during the first Sister story arc.<br /><br />The transformation technology was originally intended not to have anything to do with magic. I always figured that the anime martial arts would be related in some way, though I didn\xe2\x80\x99t initially know how it would be. The relationship with magic for both, however, was solidified once I decided upon the Dewitchery Diamond for Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s creation, and once I determined how Nanase and Susan got magic. Both date back to the first year of El Goonish Shive.<br /><br />First off, the anime style martial arts. I wanted there to be a reason why Nanase\xe2\x80\x99s magic was better than Susan\xe2\x80\x99s. It\xe2\x80\x99s evolved a bit since then how exactly their magic is different, but the basic premise that Nanase got more powerful magic due to already having magic energy as a result of practicing Anime Style Martial Arts was intended even back then.<br /><br />As for the TF gun, there has often been the question as to why the Dewitchery Diamond treated Elliot\xe2\x80\x99s transformation as a curse. This page indirectly answers that. The effects of the beam were related closely enough with standard magic and spell casting for it to count as a curse.<br /><br /><strong>Blue Hats and Wands</strong><br /><br />The first hat and wand visual I thought of for this comic was equipping some representation of energy with them, and it grew from there. I love the visual, though the TF gun may rival it. In any case, I\xe2\x80\x99d love to have a wizard\xe2\x80\x99s hat of my own, but have thus far failed to find one I like.<br /><br />I do, however, own a wand. It\xe2\x80\x99s not so good at casting magic, but it did have the distinction of being the <a href=http://www.alivans.com/custom/cart/edit.asp?p=95872>least expensive wand</a> one can order from Alivan\xe2\x80\x99s. A more expensive one will be the second thing I buy after a new hat once I&#39;m rich. And no, not a wizard&#39;s hat. My official "I&#39;m successful!" hat will be a fedora or something like it.<br /><br />The hats are all specifically blue for a reason, that reason being the wizards that came with <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Castle#Dragon_Masters_.281993.E2.80.931995.29>LEGO Dragon Master castle sets</a>. Needless to say, I had a lot of fun with those blocks. I think the wizards were supposed to be evil, but one would wind up with multiple wizards and I\xe2\x80\x99m betting I had at least one I pretended was good as far as my kingdom\xe2\x80\x99s mythology was concerned, along with his noble dragon companion.<br /><br />Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s right. My LEGO kingdoms had their own characters, plot and backstory to it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember it clearly now, but it was before even the early days of EGS, so I\xe2\x80\x99m certain there were plot holes all over the place.<br /><br /><strong>Magic Energy</strong><br /><br />I think physics experts will take issue with the term "magic energy". I\xe2\x80\x99m not actually certain, but then I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do well in that one high school Physics class I took. I would therefore like to note that the term is being used her in a loose fashion due to Mr. Verres wanting the people in the room other than Tedd, and possibly Grace, to understand.<br /><br />Unless, of course, I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong about there being in an issue, in which case Mr. Verres is saying exactly what he should in order to sound like a smarty pants.<br /><br /><strong>Who That?</strong><br /><br />The people shown in the fantasy panels are nobody in particular. Well, Ellen and Nanase are, but my point is simply that there\xe2\x80\x99s no need to wonder for hours who that girl is in panel three. Yes, she\xe2\x80\x99s cute, but most people are in my art style. My guy (I think he\xe2\x80\x99s a guy) with her in that panel is clearly a fan of Harry Potter, but that could be any number of millions of people.<br /><br /><strong>Yup</strong><br /><br />I think it would be funny if that was all the magic analysis wand outputted, but there are plot reasons for it to say more. Such is life, but I think it still works as a joke. And just so all of you can sleep at night: it would say "nope" if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any magic.', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2008-11-13', 'Id': 967, 'DateStatedAboveComic': '2008-11-13'}, 968: {'Commentary': 'This is the sort of comic I enjoy drawing, at least when it comes to parts of it.

Panel one didn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily require the visuals of magical variations of Grace, but I have difficulty imagining the comic without them.<br /><br />This comic may feel like mostly summary, particularly to the hardcore fans, but there are some key things here. For one, precisely why Mr. Verres didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize Elliot and Ellen could have awakened sooner, and why Elliot is starting out with girly spells without cat spells. Granted, one could figure out without this comic why Elliot wasn\xe2\x80\x99t getting cat spells, but that\xe2\x80\x99s dependant on how one interprets Nanase\xe2\x80\x99s earlier "related to the incident" line. Why Elliot isn\xe2\x80\x99t getting kitty spells has been asked quite frequently since that comic.<br /><br />Speaking of which, I\xe2\x80\x99m betting this comic is a bit bitter sweet for fans of cat Elliot. Yes, it includes an image of shirtless cat Elliot being shirtless, but it also confirms that there won\xe2\x80\x99t be a bunch of kitty Elliot spells any time soon. Part of the reason for this is that Elliot would enjoy getting new cat spells, and this whole situation is intended to take him outside of his comfort zone. While it would be neat to see Elliot going all catty in various way, it would be less of a burden for him, and we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get to see him deal with it in public, either.<br /><br />Given that this comic ended on a cliffhanger of sorts, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have much to say about it that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a spoiler, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll just answer this question: why is "girly Elliot\xe2\x80\x99s hair lighter than manly Elliots?" There isn\xe2\x80\x99t really a logical reason within comic continuity, but from a personal perspective, I thought he\xe2\x80\x99d appear a little more girly with lighter hair. This wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t apply to everyone (probably not most people), but in Elliot\xe2\x80\x99s case, I think it does.', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2008-11-18', 'Id': 968, 'DateStatedAboveComic': '2008-11-18'}, 969: {'Commentary': 'I drew and edited the text of this comic while sick, so I hereby decree any art mistakes, spelling errors, or characters drawn the wrong genders to be entirely the fault of disease and none of my fault whatsoever. Hooray!<br /><br />Leading up to this page, many fans questioned what was wrong with Elliot that would make things harder for him, but that was the wrong question. As this comic reveals, and answers, the CORRECT question was "why is it easier for Ellen?" This revelation opens up many possibilities, but its immediate importance is an easier time for Ellen with the unfortunate side effect of major guilt trippage.<br /><br />I\xe2\x80\x99m aware that the expressions in the last three panels might be a bit hard to read. Well, Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to look like she\xe2\x80\x99s trying to sink into the couch due to feeling bad, but everyone else\xe2\x80\x99s expressions are intentionally awkward. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say too much about what\xe2\x80\x99s going through their individual minds as it should become more apparent on its own with upcoming comics, but I will say that they\xe2\x80\x99re still processing the information and deciding what to do with it.<br /><br />This page includes several opportunities for cut-away jokes. I could have easily had an uber-magical chibi Ellen in panel two, for example. The reason there aren\xe2\x80\x99t any is the simple fact that the goal of this page is to not make light of how inconvenient this is for Elliot.<br /><br />There are those who are fans of the idea of self transformation who may not see it that way, but think what it would be like if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to transform. What if you had to transform in a way you didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to several times a day, frequently enough that it\xe2\x80\x99d have to be done while in a public place at times, had to spend several hours a week transformed to have any chance of improving your situation, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t even have the luxury of comfortably sleeping in your normal form?<br /><br />I think Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s feelings of guilt here would be perfectly natural even if she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been making fun of Elliot earlier. At the very least, it seems perfectly natural to me. I never feel good about having what I would consider to be an unfair advantage. I feel bad if that somehow happens while playing a simple board game; being in Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s shoes would make me feel awful. I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying she\xe2\x80\x99s worse off than Elliot, of course, but that\xe2\x80\x99s kinda where her guilt is coming from. Well, that, and she was making fun of him earlier, but at least she\xe2\x80\x99s feeling remorse.', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2008-11-22', 'Id': 969, 'DateStatedAboveComic': '2008-11-22'}, 970: {'Commentary': 'While Elliot is certainly pleased that he won\xe2\x80\x99t have to transform every hour, he is still definitely putting on a brave face in this comic for Ellen&#39;s benefit. He feels a huge amount of responsibility for Ellen&#39;s well being and happiness and is putting her first, meaning this effort to look on the bright side is primarily for Ellen&#39;s benefit out of consideration for Ellen&#39;s own current situation and the very circumstances of her existence. This is, of course, making Ellen feel even more like a jerk, even though that&#39;s not Elliot&#39;s goal.<br /><br />In the original script, there was one page each devoted to dreaming and wizards in spite of the fact that this page proves that you can basically boil down their concepts into a single panel once everything else is established. Verres does pretty much sum it up in this comics. Wizards are different because most people just get spells that reflect who they are while wizards can learn other peoples spells, and dreaming covers anyone who has magic abilities without having awakened.<br /><br />"Dreaming" doesn\xe2\x80\x99t specify what kind of magic the individual has, and winds up being an extremely general term as a result. Basically, it tells only this: The individual has magic, but has not been through an awakening. The exact nature of that magic could be almost anything. It may not seem like a handy term as a result, but at least it\xe2\x80\x99s quicker than saying "that guy has some magic abilities but hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been through an awakening."<br /><br />As one might guess, it\xe2\x80\x99s referred to as "dreaming" because one is usually dreaming prior to awakening, as Nanase, Elliot and Ellen were by virtue of their martial arts. As Mr. Verres already pointed out, the awakening terminology is flawed in general given that nothing is really "waking up", but that&#39;s what the rest of the terminology builds off of. It is a bit like saying one&#39;s muscles have awakened after getting buff, however, given the nature of magic in the EGS universe.<br /><br />Come to think of it, that would be a funny thing to say after going through a bunch of weight training. "My muscles... have AWAKENED!"<br /><br />Leading up to the previous page, I had said in a few places <a href=/d/20081122.html>that it</a>, not this one, would conclude this round of exposition. I never corrected myself, because I think it only makes the last panel funnier if one is genuinely thinking the same things as Sarah.<br /><br />This really is a milestone exposition wise, however, as it marks the point where pretty much all the basics are set. As far as mechanics and the rules of the universe are concerned, there shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a need for such lengthy stretches of exposition again in the foreseeable future. There\xe2\x80\x99ll still be exposition, of course, but it\xe2\x80\x99s this sort of "okay, this is so complicated that we need to gather the characters and have multiple comics of Q&A just so we can understand how this system works" sort of exposition that I am referring to. I may prove myself wrong, but that\xe2\x80\x99s where that "<em>foreseeable</em> future" bit comes in.<br /><br />Speaking of exposition, that last panel is a bit of a meta reference, without truly breaking the fourth wall, to all the exposition that has been in EGS in the past. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure who the exposition champion is, but given that Tedd and Grace would have gotten most of their information by virtue of being connected to Mr. Verres, I\xe2\x80\x99d say he winds up winning by default. That, and if he wanted to, he probably could provide exposition from now until doomsday without running out.

See? Very simple.<br /><br />What many might not have noticed is the sudden shift from color to black and white. There were several reasons for this change, most of which having to do with me enjoying the creation of the comic and keeping up a schedule.<br /><br />For one thing, I don\xe2\x80\x99t really enjoy doing color comics. I might enjoy coloring one or two specific panels, but then there are the rest to deal with. I\xe2\x80\x99ve found that I like to color singular images, but not sequential art. That\xe2\x80\x99s a term I avoid using because it sounds pretentious to me, but I feel it fits here because I\xe2\x80\x99m specifically referring to coloring a sequence of images instead of just one, and I generally don\xe2\x80\x99t have fun doing that.<br /><br />Now that I\xe2\x80\x99ve brought it up, does a single panel gag cartoon count as sequential art? I\xe2\x80\x99m taking a sequential art course this semester, so I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s one thing to ask about.<br /><br />Anyway, I DO enjoy working in black and white. A lot. It\xe2\x80\x99s just more natural and fun for me somehow, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what EGS is SUPPOSED to be for me. I\xe2\x80\x99m studying to do graphic design for other people, but EGS is meant to be the project I do where I only answer to me and do it the way I want to do it and have fun with it. While I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t object to it somehow paying all my bills, it is not my job. It is a hobby with benefits, and should be treated as such.<br /><br />Black and white is also faster to do.

The reason for this is that there&#39;s a running gag in Melonpool involving shading.

Someone&#39;s on the stairs, driving a car... you get the picture.<br /><br />The orb&#39;s design was inspired by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamcatcher">Dreamcatchers</a>, as many have already guessed. I had the grenade like sleep orb planned for a while, but the design was REALLY last minute. I wanted something associated with sleep, but not too overt. I didn&#39;t want to put a bunch of Z&#39;s on it, for example.<br /><br />So what&#39;s Abe, an English wizard doing with a magic grenade designed after an Ojibwa dream catcher? Darned if I know. Dude&#39;s traveled in his day and met other dudes who have traveled. Get off my back! Sheesh.<br /><br />I have more to say about it, but it&#39;s occurred to me that it&#39;s a minor spoiler regarding parts the rest of the arc, so I&#39;m leaving it for the last paragraph. Scroll past the "Minor Spoiler Below" warning towards the end of this commentary and read at your own (minor) peril. I&#39;m gonna talk about a couple other things before then, though.<br /><br />The explosion effect for the sleep spell grenade is essentially a series of gradients expanding from each individual section of "web" on the ball. I like the results.<br /><br />The characters going to sleep wound up creepier than I expected. Grace, confused and losing consciousness... I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s disturbing. It makes me want to give her a hug (once she wakes up, of course). Fox&#39;s vanishing is also creepier than I originally figured it would be. I pictured her sort of fading away into a vanishing cloud, but it was much less disturbing as I originally pictured it. Make a note: those who are easily creeped out would do well to dismiss summons quickly rather than gradually.<br /><br />----<br /><br />---- Minor Spoiler Below<br /><br />----<br /><br />Now that the design of the "sleep spell grenade" is based off of Dreamcatchers, I&#39;ve reached the conclusion that all dreams had as a result of it will be nightmare free. Not only does it make a certain sense given the design, but it&#39;s a sleep weapon used by a self-proclaimed "good guy".

The intention was to reflect both the eeriness of Abe getting to Ellen, and his own disorientation due to the sleep grenade.<br /><br />That said, reasons for not using the grenade earlier ahoy! This was just stated in the comic above, but just to be extra clear:<br /><br />1. Abe wasn&#39;t certain he himself would stay awake.<br /><br />2. He <em>was</em> certain <em>Raven</em> would be able to stay awake.<br /><br />3. Forcing people into sudden sleep is dangerous, and Abe considers himself to be one of the good guys.<br /><br />4.

She was a formidable enough force that countering her with anything effective would have carried that risk.<br /><br />Granted, one may not think those were good enough reasons. That doesn&#39;t really matter, though. What matters is whether Abe would consider these good reasons, and the answer is yes. Yes he would.<br /><br />I did happen to notice someone&#39;s comment that Raven&#39;s barriers would have contained the effects of the sleep grenade.

It&#39;s pretty simple, but she changes it up, so it&#39;s understandable. Here&#39;s the rundown (and remind me to add reference links to earlier comics later):<br /><br />1. Whether or not her eyes temporarily glow is simply a matter of whether her eyes are open when she uses the spell. Eyes closed, no sign of glowing eyes. Eyes open, VSSHH! She can be as stealthy or dramatic as the situation calls for.<br /><br />2. Nanase can make herself glow while the spell is in use, but it&#39;s optional. The glowing is something can choose to do to let people know that she&#39;s using the spell and not just in a coma or something. It uses a little more magic energy, however, so if there&#39;s no one to notify, that&#39;s reason enough not to turn on the glow.<br /><br />In regard to 2, I&#39;ve essentially decided that the majority of glowing effects that characters can do are optional. Any flying character used to glow, but I decided I didn&#39;t like that. Instead of pretended the characters never glowed while doing such things, I decided on some guidelines for glowing.<br /><br />Glowing now serves a function (alerting friends of spell use), is simply Sensei Greg&#39;s influence at work (Greg likes light shows with his combat), or a sign that someone is outputting an excessive amount of magic energy.

Of course, if he was thinking straight, he&#39;d remember that he <a href="/?date=2008-11-06">had sensed a number of unusual beings within the school</a>, and that it&#39;s logical to conclude that these fairies might have nothing to do with Raven. Abe, however, is not quite thinking with a full deck at the moment, and is unlikely to start while his rage still burns.<br /><br />Another significant change was the third row of panels. They were originally going to be less fluid, as in one attack wasn&#39;t going to flow into the other. Having Nanase immediately returning and struck down as the remains of the previous fairy are still falling, however, shows how determined Nanase is and how deadly and quick Abe is.<br /><br />Incidentally, those small objects on the ground to the right of Abe in the first panel of row three are remains of the doll that was destroyed in panel four.<br /><br />As far as I can recall, this page is in third place for most panels in a single update.

One could still reach that conclusion, of course, but I see it being less likely with this final version.<br /><br />Speaking of Chaos, it&#39;s probably clear by now that while she is a fan of chaos and unpredictability, Chaos herself is anything but chaotic.

In the end, I simply decided to effectively bleach and obscure the outfit she was wearing prior to casting the spell.<br /><br />It might be worth noting that this form had an impact on the design of Nanase&#39;s haircut.

There is a difference between how something is stated and what the intent behind it is, and it&#39;s important to remember the context of what&#39;s being said.<br /><br />Abe might have sworn to kill everything the diamond created, but he did this in an effort to atone for his own sins and protect people. Out of context, his oath clearly states that he must kill Ellen. In context, however, Ellen is clearly an exception, and killing her would be in violation of everything he&#39;s been fighting for.<br /><br /><em>Self Defense</em><br /><br />Nanase putting Abe in a hold and talking him down reminds me of what I was taught in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hapkido">Hapkido</a>. While we did learn some offensive techniques, most of what we learned were defensive counters. The most common defense was to block, grab, and either throw or hold the opponent in a way meant to end the fight without either combatant getting hurt.

Let&#39;s just say Amanda isn&#39;t the only scientist working there. I was searching through various names when I discovered the Japanese name "Chika", which as far as I can tell, is pronounced almost exactly like the Spanish word "Chica", meaning girl. Plotting potential jokes that could play off of that, her name was chosen.<br /><br />What Lisa says in panel four is accurate, and many questions I have received have been of the nature "what&#39;s going to happen next". Such questions will not be answered in this Q&A. What happens next is happening next, so why spoil it here in the Q&A?<br /><br />I&#39;m continuing to use 3D rendered versions of the backgrounds as guides, which I would like to note does not mean simply exporting an image and being done. They are for reference and still require additional work on my part.<br /><br />That said, I also have 3D stand-ins for the characters that look nothing like them part are to scale, which allows me to determine their actual heights. Amanda, for example, is 5&#39; 10", Lisa is 5&#39; 4", and Chika is 5&#39; 0", making them above, almost matching, and below average U.S. female heights respectively (<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_height#Average_height_around_the_world>according to Wikipedia</a>, anyway, which as we all know is infallible).', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2010-01-26', 'Id': 1051, 'DateStatedAboveComic': '2010-01-26'}, 1052: {'Commentary': 'TITLE: <em>Cousin Family Tree</em><br /><br />Yes, I know that "I have no _____" followed by the other person taking it too literally joke&#39;s been done to death. For me, however, the real joke is how serious Mrs. Kistune is and the return of "krak-a-thoom". The last panel mostly exists to close out the page and show Amanda&#39;s shrinking progress (incidentally, she&#39;s 96% normal size overall in that last panel).<br /><br />Speaking of size, Chika is on tippy-toes and stretching to get the tape measure that high in panel one, so she&#39;s even shorter than she looks. Lisa looks a little big in the first two panels, but that&#39;s perspective at work. Amanda is right by the wall while Lisa is closer to the virtual camera because, really, shy would she be up against the wall too?<br /><br />The overly dramatic second panel is basically making fun of the fact that I didn&#39;t think this would be a big reveal. I&#39;m answering it because a lot of people ask, but I thought I had effectively answered this way back when Mr. Verres referred to Nanase&#39;s mother as her sister in law, unless it was later when I revealed Nanase&#39;s last name. Anyway, those two facts together suggest either a convoluted explanation (which I am certainly capable of), or the family connection had to be between Tedd&#39;s mother and... wait a tick. That still left open the possibility of Nanase&#39;s father being the brother of Tedd&#39;s mom, didn&#39;t it?<br /><br />...Wow, I guess this really is new information. I don&#39;t know why that didn&#39;t occur to me, like, ages ago. I seriously just thought of that while typing this.

They&#39;re good questions, but the answers are fairly short without lots of padding.<br /><br />I suppose it also answers a fourth question in panel one, or at least hints at it, that question being "how do the clothes shrink too?" Amanda is giving off shrink energy intended only to shrink her clothes, and she kept the energy at a certain strength to prevent collateral shrinkage. It needs adjusting, however, as it&#39;s not giving off enough of the shrinking energy to achieve the full desired effect.<br /><br />For those keeping track, Amanda goes from 66% to 56% normal size from start to finish of this comic.

Those manual barriers made it so there wasn&#39;t a clear pattern, so people were quite fairly left wondering what was up with Nanase not being trapped in the bathroom.<br /><br />...And I only just now find myself wondering if the bathroom stall doors would have counted...

This first comic may not live up to any declarations of silliness, but that title alone should tell you something.

The difference between a first person storyline and the standard third person storyline is that only one character&#39;s thoughts are shown, so there are no thought bubbles, and any thoughts they&#39;re having are in narration boxes.<br /><br />I don&#39;t intend to do every future storyline this way, but it&#39;s something I&#39;ve wanted to try for a while. Many of my favorite books and TV shows are presented with first person narration, and it makes jumping into whatever they&#39;re thinking, in my opinion, a bit more natural.

The problem is that the transition from the previous comic combined with the layout for the rest of the panels in this comic clashed terribly when I tried to just show a speech balloon popping out from the back room. I eventually concluded that the angle had to show Elliot in order for everything else to work, so I posed him / her as best I could to have it not be too risque.<br /><br />That said, I don&#39;t think I did that great a job drawing the removed shirt. I wanted it to cover up Elliot adequately without looking like it shrunk or grew, but it winds up looking more like a small towel. I consider it a relatively minor issue, so I intend to just move on with keeping ahead with comics instead of toying with it. For the record, however, I am aware that it&#39;s not my finest work.<br /><br />I don&#39;t think I do, but if I HAD to justify Tedd randomly turning on the TV, it&#39;s because he was switching the input mode of the television given that he was done with the initial data gathering, and the news just happened to be on. I don&#39;t think he would get bored enough to flip on the tube with the intent of watching something in the few seconds Elliot was back there.<br /><br />"Truthiness" might sound familiar to fans of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Colbert>Stephen Colbert</a>. My initial intent was simply to have a wrong-sounding variation of "<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X_Files>the truth is out there</a>", but everything I came up with was so close to "truthiness" that I just figured I should go ahead and make it a bonus reference for people to get.

It used to be dismissed as a city with frequent tabloid nonsense, but now it&#39;s being taken seriously and a lot of the people in town are just visiting and/or up to something.

I also briefly considered changing his last narration in this comic to a speech bubble due to it being odd to <em>think</em> "gah!", but quickly decided it to be awesome that he actually thought "gah!" Your opinions regarding the awesomeness of thinking "gah!" may vary.<br /><br />I fully expect this comic to make some people worry about how relevant this will be to the plot and whether this part of the storyline is necessary. I would snarkishly say "wait a couple days and see", but given how many rewrites occurred during <a href="http://www.egscomics.com/index.php?arcid=57">Sister 2</a> that resulted in <a href="http://www.egscomics.com/?date=2008-06-25">extraneous exposition of not much importance</a>, it&#39;s a somewhat valid concern.

Yay poor planning!<br /><br />That said, this storyline was written in advance and Ellen casting this spell fits the story in several ways. The only way I&#39;m going to say here on account of spoilers is that a new, non-V5 spell for Ellen was horribly overdue. That fact doesn&#39;t technically serve <em>this</em> storyline specifically, but it is true and important for the long-term.<br /><br />If I may again bring up the horrible amount of rewrites for Sister 2, <a href="http://www.egscomics.com/?date=2009-03-03">I had originally planned</a> to have Ellen briefly offer up some resistance to Abraham, at which point she would have shown off a variation of her beam that would have been similar to Nanase&#39;s fairy punch attack. This would have simply bought some additional time for Nanase to regain consciousness, so it wouldn&#39;t have changed much beyond making Abraham&#39;s acceptance of Ellen not being dangerous more illogical.<br /><br />The new spell was written out for a lot of reasons, but she might still wind up with a combat spell similar to that someday.

I fully admit this storyline is progressing at a leisurely pace, though it&#39;s worth noting I was raised on <em><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simspons>The Simpsons</a></em>, a show that has frequently had first acts that lead into the final two while having little to nothing to do with them up until right before the commercial break.<br /><br />Reason #2 for introducing this spell now: the reintroduction of Mrs. Dunkel, who has not been in the comic for years. It&#39;s a character trait of both of their parents to be overly accepting of and nonchalant about the strange things that happen with their children, particularly given the very nature of Ellen&#39;s being. It&#39;s not that they don&#39;t care; they&#39;re just unusual people.<br /><br />Mrs. Dunkel&#39;s hair has always been a bit of a riddle to me.

I decided there needed to be some guideline for drawing her elaborate hair, and eventually settled on a clockwise buzzsaw (clockwise from the front, anyhow).

Both Catalina and Susan are wearing relatively new outfits. <a href="http://www.egscomics.com/egsnp/?date=2010-02-12">Susan first wore hers in an EGS:NP</a>, and Catalina was first seen wearing her&#39;s <a href="http://www.egscomics.com/sketchbook/?date=2010-04-13">in a sketchbook entry</a>.<br /><br />I first saw someone wearing a cropped jacket like the one Catalina&#39;s wearing on <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonball_z>Dragonball Z</a>, but that was a guy wearing it and if he wasn&#39;t a cartoon character, I don&#39;t think it would have been flattering. Later on, a female friend of mine with a tendency to wear cool, interesting outfits was wearing one, and I realized that women could genuinely pull off that look without looking silly (even if the jacket is technically illogical in failing to cover one&#39;s midsection).<br /><br />...What? You think Catalina does look silly in that outfit? You think it looks like something from out of the eighties or some other decade that is not current? You think I like weird fashion? That&#39;s absurd! Completely and totally absurd! How dare you say such absurd things!<br /><br />The last line in this comic may seem unnecessary (probably because it is), but it just bugged me too much to not at least acknowledge that it&#39;s odd that they were walking to the comic shop when there&#39;s a parking lot right in front of it.<br /><br />I can think of several explanations as to why Susan would park elsewhere, such as it being a habit, not liking the parking lot outside of the shop (the parking lot of the store that inspired the one in this comic was certainly bad enough that I would sometimes park elsewhere), they were getting lunch and parked closer to there, etc. I just figured it&#39;d be easier to hang a lampshade on it than give an excuse.<br /><br />In retrospect, however, I should&#39;ve just had them try to park there because then I could&#39;ve had a simple car interior as the majority of the background and wouldn&#39;t have to draw TREES! EVIL, TREACHEROUS TREES! Darn you, <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treebeard>Treebeard</a>! I was on your side, but after this?! No wonder no one is on your side!

Long commentary. Time to get all categorical up in this joint.<br /><br /><strong>Catalina</strong><br /><br />Catalina is one of those characters who would likely be rather frustrating to know in person, but is hopefully fun as a character in a comic. She&#39;s not intentionally mean, but she&#39;s definitely somewhat rude and has a temper. She&#39;s the sort of person I would likely initially want to strangle only to eventually find her bluntness charming and enjoy her company. Believe me, I speak from experience on this matter. I can think of at least four friends of mine off the top of my head who fit this description.<br /><br />I was hoping to have her get excited about something other than a <em><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xena>Xena</a></em> RPG. It&#39;s a little on the nose, and from what I&#39;ve head about the lesbian undertones of that series might come off as a bit stereotypical. That is exactly, however, why it made sense to have it be a <em><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xena>Xena</a></em> game. I&#39;m assuming most people still know that Xena was a show about a badass action girl of the warrior and princess variety, which has the benefit of being something most people will get without me having to explain.<br /><br />Catalina&#39;s likes and dislikes haven&#39;t been explored enough for there to be a "that&#39;s something appropriate to her tastes that would be in a comic store" stand in, so yes, I effectively went the generic route in the hopes of quickly conveying something. <br /><br />That said, I&#39;ve only actually seen one episode of <em><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xena>Xena</a></em> that I can remember, and I remember it being good. Xena and her spunky female companion were being coerced by some thief to go somewhere and do... something. I don&#39;t remember all of the details, obviously, but what I do clearly remember is it not sucking. It&#39;s a series I might one day consider renting, but given how long my current "check this bit of pop culture out" list is, it will probably be a while before I get to it.<br /><br /><strong>Exposition</strong><br /><br />I want people who have previously complained about the amount of exposition in previous comics to at least give me some credit with this update. Justin was perfectly set up to thoroughly recap information regarding Pandora showing up on television and paranormal tourists and what-not, but instead only said what he thought the reason for more customers was, why he thought that was the reason, and his rational for it. It may be exposition, but a recap it&#39;s not and it&#39;s only three sentences.<br /><br />The lack of repetitive exposition in this comic is partly due to me treating <em>Bringing Silly Back</em> as a book, which helps me determine if and when something should be recapped and when certain things should be foreshadowed. Anyone who has read the previous storylines of <em>BSB</em> knows full well what Justin is talking about in panel three, so any clarifying dialogue that could have occurred is thrown of a bridge so that the plot may continue onward.<br /><br />One thing I do sort of recap here that some may feel unnecessary is the nature of the hammers. Granted, the recap consists of the words "to stun offensive men" and is otherwise sandwiched in a non-recap that sets up a punchline. If one cannot forgive four words thrown in to vaguely remind people of something that hasn&#39;t come up in the story in years and matters to the current plot, then I truly do apologize for the agonizing pain those four words must have inflicted.<br /><br />And yes, those two weirdos in the last panel were in a <a href="http://www.egscomics.com/sketchbook/?date=2010-04-13">sketchbook entry</a>. Thank you for noticing.<br /><br /><strong>Backgrounds and Extras</strong><br /><br />The layout of this comic shop is roughly based on a comic shop I used to frequent. The designs of two of the extras in panel two are loosely based on people I would hang out with at said shop, and one of them even used to work there. I assure you that the extra with the hat in the last panel is certainly not intended to resemble anyone in particular whatsoever, though it is apparent that he is a man.<br /><br />This comic wound up being more of an experiment in backgrounds than I thought it would be. This is a scene where I felt it necessary to have a busy background, in part because the scene calls for a shop with lots of people in it, and partly because that&#39;s what comic shops are like. Granted, most of the people are in that "back" Justin mentioned (which feels more like the front given its proximity to the street) where the gaming tables are, but given what&#39;s been established it would seem contrary to not show at least a few extras in-panel.<br /><br />Point is, I&#39;ve been struggling with finding a desired middle ground for backgrounds. Something between gradients and fully detailed, aka something between throwing my hands up into the air in defeat and shooting myself in the foot.<br /><br />While there is certainly room for improvement, I feel the outline-less shapes is a good approach for background elements that aren&#39;t being interacted with or focused on but should logically be visible. It gives strong contrast with the characters who are being focused on, something that has to be constantly monitored when working in a greyscale medium. It&#39;s a lot faster to put together, which is good when one is working by their lonesome and wants to update frequently, and it&#39;s not just random shapes and tone shifting. There&#39;s actual structure to the outline-less blobs that result in a minimalist background appearance while still portraying where the characters are relative to their environment.<br /><br />So yeah, I&#39;m pretty much sold on using the outline-less structured blob method when appropriate. If nothing else, the previous comic would have been done hours earlier had I been using it and probably would have looked better at the same time, so yay for time saving methods that up contrast while still allowing for busy backgrounds.', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2010-04-16', 'Id': 1081, 'DateStatedAboveComic': '2010-04-16'}, 1082: {'Commentary': 'If you&#39;re confused as to where Justin is looking in panel four of this comic, look behind his head in panel two of the <a href="http://www.egscomics.com/?date=2010-04-16">previous comic</a>. Do this, and you can feel the satisfaction of a master sleuth by figuring where Catalina got that toy hammer.<br /><br />If you consider it odd that they have toy hammers, you might technically be right by present standards, but their presence is based on plastic hammers that were sold in comic shops in connection with the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor_%28Marvel_Comics%29><em>Thor</em> franchise</a>, hence the "for Asgard!" line. I didn&#39;t buy one, but I look forward to the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor_%28film%29><em>Thor</em> movie</a> coming out as that will likely give me another opportunity to do so.<br /><br />I like the dialogue between the two weirdo jerks in this comic and don&#39;t regret it going on as long as it does, though it is a bit odd that neither Susan nor Justin speaks up before panel three.<br /><br />My excuse for Justin is simply that he believe Susan would rather fight her own battles (and he&#39;d be right), but I actually cut exposition that explains Susan&#39;s reason. Given the current atmosphere in Moperville, summoning mystic hammers out of thin air is probably a bad idea, so I had at one point planned on Susan expressing that point along with her intent to resist hammering anyone.<br /><br />I decided it was overly finicky to bother with and that it would hurt pacing, but if you think I was wrong about that, feel free to let me know. This storyline is very much part of a greater experiment where I try to limit exposition and recaps, so if at the end of this you think I cut too much or not enough, <a href=http://www.egscomics.com/contact.page>feel free to let me know the specifics of what you think</a>.', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2010-04-19', 'Id': 1082, 'DateStatedAboveComic': '2010-04-19'}, 1083: {'Commentary': '<a href="http://www.egscomics.com/sketchbook/?date=2010-04-20">Yes, Sarah has a hairband now.</a><br /><br />A trimmed down version of this comic was originally going to be a standalone <a href=http://www.egscomics.com/egsnp/>EGS:NP</a> gag strip with no impact whatsoever on the main storyline, but like so many aspects of this storyline, one idea led to another and suddenly it had to become an incident in canon and specifically in this storyline.<br /><br />I was somewhat indecisive about what days of the week this storyline would take place during, and actually didn&#39;t consider the potential continuity confusioncaused by <a href="http://www.egscomics.com/?date=2010-04-05">Elliot&#39;s "playdate" with Noah</a> when I settled on <a href="http://www.egscomics.com/?date=2010-04-14">Tuesday</a> for these scenes.

He&#39;s just absent-minded and not too bright. He&#39;s actually intelligent, but he doesn&#39;t really focus enough most of the time for it to matter.<br /><br />I noticed in response to the last comic the argument that Sarah should take this as a compliment, the rationale being that Elliot is so in wuv with Sarah that the form he assumed was how he saw her, i.e. he views her in an idealized way. I can sort of see the logic, but it still sounds like saying "this is you, but hotter" or "this is how I pretend you look". That&#39;s... no. I cannot see either of those being complimentary.<br /><br />If I had a lady friend who was a shapeshifter, I might ask her to show me what I&#39;d look like as an idealized (in my opinion) version of myself, and then that would be cool. If I asked her to try to look like me as I am now and then she went for the idealized instead, that wouldn&#39;t be cool.<br /><br />What? Of course I&#39;ve thought about it. I&#39;m bound to have to deal with this issue at some point.<br /><br />...Actually, you know what? I really do have to deal with this sort of thing, and I&#39;m the shapeshifter. Metaphorically, anyway. I&#39;m a cartoonist, and it&#39;s common for people to want me to draw them. How detailed do I get? Do I draw them "warts and all" or be cosmetically selective? It&#39;s ultimately a matter of who I&#39;m drawing and what they&#39;d prefer, but it&#39;s something I genuinely have to consider and it can make for awkward social situations.<br /><br />It may sound superficial, and it is, but I know first hand about the whole "things I&#39;d rather not be in or changed for the drawing" thing. For example, the fun, embarrassing fact that I have a bald spot  on the back of my head. I do not like this bald spot. If someone were to draw a cartoon of me, I&#39;d rather not be reminded of that bald spot when looking at it, and would much prefer they draw hair there.<br /><br />It&#39;s silly and inaccurate, but I&#39;m human, flawed, and feel bad every time I see that stupid bald spot. As such, if someone would prefer my drawing of them include an inaccuracy, they get to have that inaccuracy, darn it. It might be healthier if we were all perfectly happy with our looks, but we are imperfect beings. I encourage everyone to be as happy as they can be with their looks and to not do harmful things to alter their appearance, but I&#39;m sure we all have things we wish were different about ourselves.<br /><br />...Wow, that got really personal and serious there.

I will answer at the end of the commentary, so you have until you finish reading this to remember (or Google it).<br /><br />This particular storyline has been in the back of my mind for a long time now, and this comic pretty much sums up the primary reason it could be considered a bad idea.

I don&#39;t know if he ever actually ate that stack and I didn&#39;t see any sides, but still. Maybe I should have added more sausages? Everyone likes sausages (especially vegetarians).<br /><br />Anyway, <em>Man Vs Food</em> is a strangely engaging show. Part of me feels like I should be opposed to people eating large meals just for the sake of eating large meals, but then another part of me tells the first part to stop being a curmudgeon and enjoy the show. I have no real motivation for rooting for the host to succeed in eating an absurdly large meal, but I find I want him to do well anyway. Maybe I just instinctively want the protagonists of TV shows to be successful in their endeavors. In any case, it is a fun show.', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2010-05-12', 'Id': 1092, 'DateStatedAboveComic': '2010-05-12'}, 1093: {'Commentary': 'You can only <a href="/?date=2003-01-07">talk about something</a> without giving the details<a href="/?date=2008-08-21"> so many times</a>  before people demand to hear more.

It was a post in response to some who perceived the last paragraph of the last commentary as an insult, which was not my intent.<br /><br />As I&#39;ve mentioned, I done thunk up the majority of this plot a while ago. Back in the day, I agreed that the logic behind the monster&#39;s attack was sound, but the more I thought about, the more it became apparent that it really would have been smartest to just stay away from Susan. It seems reasonable to me that If I could realize this, so would Susan.<br /><br />I waffled like a pancake several times over whether Nanase and Susan would attempt to tell anyone about the monster&#39;s attack, but in the end it just seemed more natural for them to at least try to tell someone given the potential danger to others. One of the reasons I was hesitant was because I quickly get frustrated with stories where young people tell the truth but older people don&#39;t listen to the point of absolute stupidity (the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007TKGQW?ie=UTF8&tag=elgoonishsh04-20&linkCode=as2,amp=1789,reative=390957,reativeASIN=B0007TKGQW">A Series Of Unfortunate Events</a> movie, anyone?).<br /><br />And now the forum quote clarifying what I meant with the previous commentary&#39;s last paragraph:<br /><br /><br />[quote=I]<br />I&#39;m going to break my "stay out of reaction threads" rule momentarily to point out that my intent wasn&#39;t to insult the intelligence of the readers. The idea was that my reasoning as to why it didn&#39;t count as a vampire sounded less like concrete logic and more like excuses as to why MY monster was a totally non-vampire original. The reference to panel two was in reference to people not buying into the excuses and recognizing it for the variation on vampires that it is.<br /><br />That, and I honestly believe if the comic hadn&#39;t brought up vampires but instead just described a long-lived being that seduces women and sucks their blood, people would rightfully call me out on trying to pass a vampire off as something else.<br /><br />Frankly? With all the variations on vampires in fiction, mythology, etc, this thing may as well be referred to as a vampire. The only qualification for being an Aberration in this context is being a human who turned themselves into a parasite to achieve near-immortality. That could mean any number of things, and referring to this thing as a "vampire" variety of aberration makes as much sense as anything else. Giving this specific variety of aberration a title other than vampire sounds... well, it makes me feel like I did when I said "EGS mythology" in the commentary. It seems overly anal and unnecessary to call it something else.<br /><br />Besides which, undead don&#39;t exist in EGS (the closest thing would be animating corpses like puppets, which I don&#39;t think counts), so this is pretty much as close as a monster in EGS is going to get to being a genuine vampire.<br /><br />Also, no time travel.

Given the power she has at her disposal, even if she shouldn&#39;t feel guilty about not being able to help, I think it&#39;s pretty much unavoidable.

The idea of having the question mark there when it isn&#39;t a question is to imply that sort of tone in spite of it not being a question (think the "Valley Girl" stereotype), whereas the lack of a question mark on a question generally suggests the question doesn&#39;t have that tone shift, possibly being flat, curt, and/or simply sounding like a statement.', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2010-06-23', 'Id': 1109, 'DateStatedAboveComic': '2010-06-23'}, 1110: {'Commentary': 'I&#39;m betting all you hip kids know who <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Gleason">Jackie Gleason</a> is, but for the 99% of you who are utterly baffled by the mention of this alleged "Santa Claus", allow me to explain.

I know just a tiny bit of the base is visible in panel three, but it&#39;s there.<br /><br />Something I forgot to mention in the previous comic&#39;s commentary (and almost forgot to mention AGAIN) was Grace&#39;s line about Susan&#39;s fairy vanishing. The fact that the fairy vanished during the angst-splosion could have been revealed in a better way, but there&#39;s a reason it wasn&#39;t: the fairy unsummoning was the result of a rewrite.<br /><br />I had originally planned for the fairy to stick around, but I kept finding myself leaving her out of panels. Then I realized that showing Susan&#39;s emotions via the fairy was counter-productive to what was happening with her character, so I stopped trying to find places to include the fairy.<br /><br />While finishing up the previous comic, I realized that the missing fairy was going to become a big unexplained plot hole and that I had one last logical shot at inserting an explanation, which was at the point when the girls were gathering up their things to leave. Grace&#39;s line is basically her confirming her suspicions that there is no fairy left to bring with them.<br /><br />It was an imperfect solution, but pretty much the only one I had left myself. If I didn&#39;t explain its whereabouts, some people would be wondering why I had left it vague and start speculating about what problems the missing fairy might cause, turning it into a very unintentional red herring.', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2010-08-02', 'Id': 1124, 'DateStatedAboveComic': '2010-08-02'}, 1125: {'Commentary': 'I was very undecided as to whether I should include this moment with Nanase and Susan in <em>Hammerchlorians</em>.

This comic was on the verge of being the same text with the visuals being limited to the Moperville South small cafeteria.<br /><br />I was all prepared to make the comic, which would have been relatively quick to do given the simplicity and the setting already having been designed, when I was reminded of <a href="/?date=2003-06-22">older comics</a> where I had <a href="/?date=2003-07-10">fantasy visuals</a> without changing anything else. I really wanted to do it with this comic and some previous ones, but with all the magic and illusory stuff that&#39;s been established in EGS over the years, I&#39;ve worried about it causing confusion.<br /><br />And so, with the skill of a seasoned politician, I shifted the decision onto others and <a href="http://twitter.com/dantheshive/status/23251598491">asked people on Twitter</a> whether I should go with the crazy fantasy visuals. It was pretty much unanimous that I should.<br /><br />I&#39;m glad I did and I hope people enjoy it, but it meant that instead of being able to get right into drawing a relatively simple comic, I had to do some extra research and find references. I wound up tweeting about a <a href="http://twitter.com/dantheshive/status/23257821616">particular moment</a> from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EN71DG?ie=UTF8&tag=elgoonishsh04-20&linkCode=as2,amp=1789,reative=390957,reativeASIN=B001EN71DG"><em>The Empire Strikes Back</em></a> yesterday that seemed random at the time, but one can now likely guess how it wound up on my mind.<br /><br /><strong>BatGrace</strong><br /><br />Another scene cut from <a href="/index.php?arcid=74"><em>Hammerchlorians</em></a> was Grace ranting about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman">Batman</a> and how it was actually wrong of him to let <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_%28comics%29">The Joker</a> live.<br /><br />This is something I&#39;ve actually believed myself for a long time. The Joker always escapes from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkham_Asylum">Arkham Asylum</a>, and he always winds up hurting and killing people. The Joker&#39;s life is simply not worth the lives of others, and letting him live is essentially the same as allowing a random portion of the population to suffer and die later.<br /><br />I know the wardens are likely to say "<em>this</em> time, he&#39;s not escaping" every time they catch him, but let&#39;s face it. In the world of Batman, Joker ain&#39;t staying locked up.<br /><br />Since then, however, I&#39;ve concluded that it&#39;s wrong to blame Batman for the Joker being allowed to continuously kill people. Batman is a vigilante, meaning he is technically a criminal himself. He&#39;s serving the greater good and even works alongside the police, but much of what he does is illegal. If he wants to keep law enforcement on his side and truly be a servant of justice, it is neither his place or wise for him to kill criminals. It is his place to protect people, bring criminals to justice and let the courts determine their punishment.<br /><br />So, in short, I blame <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotham_City">Gotham</a>&#39;s judicial system. Come to think of it, the fact that they even need Batman says something about them.<br /><br /><strong>Lantern Justin and Grace</strong><br /><br />I dedicate this panel to Lewis Lovhaug, AKA <a href="http://atopfourthwall.blogspot.com/">Linkara</a>. I knew about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Jordan">Hal Jordan</a> becoming a villain and there being a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Rayner">new Green Lantern</a> as a result of reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_%28magazine%29">Wizard Magazine</a> back in the day (I read it in the hopes of better understanding comics so I could be super kewl), but I did not know about the retcon that came later prior to watching Linkara&#39;s <a href="http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/linkara/at4w/5906-top15worst">Top 15 Worst Heroes Becoming Villains</a> video.<br /><br />Without that knowledge, there would be no reference to a giant malevolent space bug, and the world would be a little less brighter.<br /><br />Panel three also references <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_man">Iron Man</a>. Tony Stark, the man beneath the iron, has had issues with alcohol in the past, hence why misguided-drunk-coerced-infected-lantern-Justin has a goatee like Stark&#39;s and a martini symbol on his chest.<br /><br />Speaking of Wizard magazine, I&#39;m suddenly reminded of several articles I read in it, all about revisions being made of characters for the 90s. In addition to Hal Jordan, I remember reading about Batman <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azrael_%28comics%29#Batman_comics">getting replaced with Azrael</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaman#New_direction">Aquaman getting a hand replaced with a harpoon</a>. I seem to recall weird stuff going on with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman">Superman</a>, too...<br /><br />I picked a lovely time to try and get into super hero comics, didn&#39;t I?<br /><br /><strong>The Justin Menace and The Justin Strikes Back</strong><br /><br />In case it&#39;s not apparent from the headline, I&#39;m talking about the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EN71DG?ie=UTF8&tag=elgoonishsh04-20&linkCode=as2,amp=1789,reative=390957,reativeASIN=B001EN71DG"><em>Star Wars</em></a> panels, four and five, now.<br /><br />It&#39;s kind of cheating to have two <em>Star Wars</em> panels in a row, but hey, at least I reference <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider_man">Spider-Man&#39;s</a> power and responsibility bit in panel five. It&#39;s also a bit odd that there&#39;s something of a time paradox going on. Grace is Anakin in panel four, but Justin is Vader in panel five while Grace has become Luke. I&#39;m not sure how the time-space continuum hasn&#39;t exploded, but I think we&#39;re all still here...<br /><br />Panel four brings up a nitpicky point from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EN71DQ?ie=UTF8&tag=elgoonishsh04-20&linkCode=as2,amp=1789,reative=390957,reativeASIN=B001EN71DQ">Episode One of Star Wars</a>, but I consider it just that: a nitpick, and not a well-thought out one, either. Yoda is explaining to a child why fear can be bad. Expecting him to be thorough, effectively adding an asterisk to his statement saying "oh, yeah, and they don&#39;t necessarily have to be in that order" seems not only unnecessary, but could also easily confuse the point that he&#39;s trying to convey to a little kid.<br /><br />Nonetheless, nitpickery can be fun and it amuses me that Grace would bring up the nitpick, so there it is.<br /><br />I wound up making a simple 3D set for panel five. I could have just referenced the movie, but there were changes I wanted to make to better fit the panel, my art style, and what the panel was going for, so I just went ahead and made my own version of it. If you look at the actual movie, there&#39;s a lot more clutter, which works better with motion or a sequence than with a single panel.<br /><br /><strong>SHAZAM!</strong><br /><br />If you&#39;re tempted to try and decipher the deeper meaning of Justin referencing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Marvel_%28DC_Comics%29">Captain Marvel</a> (a kid says "SHAZAM!" to transform into an adult super hero), don&#39;t bother. Up to that point, everything Justin was referencing, quoting and paraphrasing made sense in context, but I wanted to end with nonsense while still referencing something. "SHAZAM!" seemed the logical choice.', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2010-09-08', 'Id': 1139, 'DateStatedAboveComic': '2010-09-08'}, 1140: {'Commentary': 'Shockingly, this comic implies that there are other Salty Cracker Comics locations! Or at least one ...Yay?<br /><br />After some of the responses to the past two comics, I was tempted to edit the dialogue for this comic so Grace was quoting Webster&#39;s dictionary definition of the auxiliary verb form of "have". Some people seemed to interpret "have to fight" as "if someone is doing something I don&#39;t like and I want them to stop but I can&#39;t talk them out of it, I&#39;m going to attack with lethal force."<br /><br /><em>...What?</em><br /><br />I can see that being the interpretation if certain people or characters were to say something like that, but this was coming from <em>Grace</em>. Her frame of reference in regard to what sort of things she might have to fight are <a href="/?date=2002-03-09">muggers with daggers</a>, <a href="/?date=2002-11-26">goo monsters</a>, <a href="/?date=2004-04-17">murderous super beings like Damien</a>, and <a href="/index.php?arcid=67">murderous jackass wizards</a>, and this is also combined with recently learning the <a href="/?date=2008-01-15">depths and scope of evil humanity is capable of</a> and the <a href="/?date=2008-02-12">possible consequences of letting an evil like Damien live.</a><br /><br />Not only that, but in story continuity, this scene is <a href="/?date=2010-06-25">less than a week after she didn&#39;t attack Jerry</a>. As much as she jumped the gun and could&#39;ve made things worse in that scene,, note how quickly she was deflated and how, again, <em>she did not attack.</em><br /><br />Long story short, the context of "have" was "no other option but to fight". This implies extreme circumstances where talking, fleeing, scaring away by transforming, etc., have all failed or weren&#39;t options. That&#39;s what Grace was saying she&#39;d respond with extreme force to. It&#39;s not suggesting Grace would go all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judge_dredd">Judge Dredd</a> and attack someone with intent to kill if they littered in spite of her objections or something.<br /><br />Okay, rant over!

While I don&#39;t actually think that I&#39;m super smart or that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_trek">Star Trek</a> is sucky science fiction, everything else he&#39;s saying is something I have been trying to explain to people for years. For whatever reason, it has been a difficult concept to convey. As such, I have made a <a href="http://danshive.blogspot.com/2010/09/other-universes-and-why-we-probably.html">blog post</a> that will hopefully finally make this hypothesis clear. <br /><br /><strong>References</strong><br /><br />One of the things I like about this comic is that a lot of it is supposed to go over Elliot&#39;s head, so if one doesn&#39;t get the references, they&#39;re right there with Elliot. For those who would like to get the references and currently don&#39;t, however...<br /><br /><strong>Panels 2-3</strong> - This guy isn&#39;t intended as a reference to anything in particular. He&#39;s just supposed to be a little scary looking. Panel 3 does reference <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1401226183?ie=UTF8&tag=elgoonishsh04-20&linkCode=as2,amp=1789,reative=390957,reativeASIN=1401226183">Power Girl</a>, however, who is a particularly well-endowed super hero.<br /><br /><strong>Panel 4 -</strong> Both things being referenced are <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-man">Spider-Man</a></em> story arcs. <em>One More Day</em> seems to be more controversial and probably deserves to be, but I have a personal connection with the <em>Clone Saga</em> that makes me dislike it more. Put simply, the <em>Clone Saga</em> was starting just as I first tried to get into Spider-Man comics.<br /><br />Yeah. That was bad timing.<br /><br />In addition, since I don&#39;t read Spider-Man but do enjoy funny rants and comics <em>about</em> Spider-Man, <em>One More Day</em> is actually a boon for me. Seriously, it&#39;s inspired so much humor of the variety that I enjoy that if I were to be entirely selfish in my view of it, I would be happy for it. Of course, I&#39;m not, so enjoying the humor that has resulted is something of a guilty pleasure.<br /><br /><strong>Panel 5 -</strong> This is in reference to actual rules for the <em><a href="http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Default.aspx">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> card game. None of that is made up. Creature have states known as power and toughness, which is what the four-four (4/4) and one-one (1/1)refer to. There is an actual scenario in the game where if you cast a spell called Diminish and a spell called Giant Growth, regardless of which was cast first, the creature will become 4/4 due to the layer rules for determining a creature&#39;s current power and toughness. There are seven layers, and layer seven has sub-layers. Based on my notes, what Duck (the kid talking about it) says in regard to layers 7B and 7C is accurate.<br /><br /><strong>Panel 6 -</strong> <a href="http://danshive.blogspot.com/2010/09/other-universes-and-why-we-probably.html">Read my epically long blog post, darn it!</a> The reason this is in reference to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_trek">Star Trek</a>, however, is multiple instances of parallel universes and the many, many logic errors one can nitpick about them. Nonetheless, I wuv those episodes, and would only make the same claim as my doppelganger here in jest.<br /><br />Panel 7 - The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Age_of_Comic_Books">Silver Age</a> refers to a specific time in comics. This guy looks and is dressed like a generic mobster from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman">Batman</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman">Superman</a> comics of that era, and his dialogue is intentionally overly descriptive to be similar to the style of those comics.<br /><br />In fact, if you want to see a fine example of the Silver Age, generic mobsters, etc, then you should watch <a href="http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/linkara/at4w/3337-batman-147">this Atop The Fourth Wall video</a>. If you don&#39;t have a feel for the Silver Age before watching that, you will afterward.<br /><br />Silver Age Superman is, in my opinion, hilarious. I have a trade paperback of some of those comics, and I can&#39;t help but laugh every time I see this one diagram for Superman&#39;s anti-radiation lead suit. It&#39;s got a TV inside it and everything. I don&#39;t know if they intended for it to be hilarious, but by golly, it is.<br /><br />Also, he could supposedly juggle planets.<br /><br /><strong>Comic "Difficulty"</strong><br /><br />This is REALLY behind the scenes and very nerdy, so if that doesn&#39;t interest you, you may wish to flee now. It&#39;s the last part of the commentary, so you wouldn&#39;t be missing anything else.<br /><br />I have a system for determining how "difficult" a comic is to make. I <a href="http://twitter.com/dantheshive">tweeted</a> about this comic&#39;s difficulty rating earlier, but have since revised the system. The difficulty is now equal to how many average comics it is equal to. An average comic has 18 primary components (6 backgrounds, 12 character drawings), and the difficulty is determined by calculating how many of these components are present and dividing by 18 (although I might treat really simple components as 1/2 a component or nothing). In the interest of keeping to a schedule, it&#39;s advantageous for me to stick to an average difficulty of 1 or less.<br /><br />Both the <a href="/?date=2010-09-15">previous comic</a> and this one have 1.3 difficulties, and <a href="/?date=2010-09-17">Monday&#39;s</a> was a .83 on account of less than 12 character drawings and some copy/paste abuse. In the end, this week averaged a difficulty of 1.14, which isn&#39;t <em>too</em> bad.<br /><br />As pointless as this might appear, it&#39;s an equation that can help me put things in perspective in terms of whether I might want to edit a script, find a way to reuse a background, how much time I&#39;ll likely need to finish a comic, etc.<br /><br />It should also help me look at upcoming scripts and/or outlines and plan out my week, and let me know beyond a shadow of a doubt whether I&#39;m trying to do too much. If I add up the numbers and discover I&#39;m averaging a 1.5, for example, that might be a sign that script revisions are called for, or that I simply will not be doing much else that week.', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2010-09-17', 'Id': 1143, 'DateStatedAboveComic': '2010-09-17'}, 1144: {'Commentary': 'The "Superman Cartoons" being referred to here are most definitely the ones done in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Timm">Bruce Timm</a> style.

What I&#39;ve actually read and seen of these characters is very limited, I admit, but of what little I have had exposure to, I consider these versions are the winners.<br /><br />To be honest, however, I was originally going to include a line of dialogue from the show that would have excluded it from being anything real, but simply ran out of good places to put it in the editing process. Without giving any context, I was going to have a speech bubble from the television saying "don&#39;t make me juggle Earth, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luthor">Luthor</a>!"<br /><br />Panel four should ring true to pretty much anyone who has hung out in a place of business that does not allow the customers to use the store&#39;s bathroom. Any business within walking distance with a public restroom readily available quickly gains visitors from the first location.<br /><br />Come to think of it, there could be a dastardly conspiracy at work there. A grand scheme of the various shop owners to make sure the local businesses all flourish together so customers have plenty of reasons to venture to that shopping location. Yes... it all makes sense now...<br /><br />The layout for this comic proved extremely tricky given what I wanted to show in each panel and the order of characters talking, and I believe I screwed up with panels three and four. The positioning of Justin with Elliot in panel three and George in panel four sort of make it look like Elliot just sort of morphed into George. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the sort of thing that would confuse anyone, but it&#39;s still not good that it looks like that. It was a realization that came too late in the process for me to do anything about without severely delaying the comic, however, so there it is.<br /><br />There&#39;s probably an easier way to get a smooth progression of letters descending in size as they are in the last panel, but the method I used was approximately making each font size approximately 88% of the font size of the letter that preceded it.

It was sort of fun and "cool", kind of like lite version of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klingon_language"><em>Klingon</em> language</a>.<br /><br />As potentially fun as that is, I look back it as as pretty poor storytelling. When presenting a foreign language in a comic, I think it&#39;s best to consider a yes or no question: Do I want the audience to understand what&#39;s being said? If yes, translate it. If no, present it as gibberish. <br /><br />Otherwise, one is giving people who know the language and people who don&#39;t a different experience.

How should she do this?"<br /><br />The original panel three gag was "here&#39;s a panel of someone being surprised about something else" and would have featured Sarah being startled by a spider. I actually like that joke a lot more, but it occurred to me that not addressing when Elliot learned Carol was Sarah&#39;s sister would introduce a plot hole <a href="/?date=2009-02-21">due to a scene in Sister 2.</a><br /><br />As for how I allowed such a potential plot hole to exist in the first place, it&#39;s simple: I hadn&#39;t originally planned on them being related. When I finally decided I simply had to give the recurring news reporter character a last name, however, it occurred to me that there could be much fun to be had if she turned out to be related to Sarah. And thus, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retcon">retcon</a> was born.<br /><br />Seeing as how one of the most common questions I get is "do Sarah and/or Justin have siblings", this has GOT to make someone somewhere happy, if no one else.<br /><br />As for Elliot not immediately recognizing her earlier, keep in mind that Carol is several years Sarah&#39;s senior. Odds are good he was in elementary school when he last saw her, and if Sarah&#39;s look in panel three is any indication, Sarah&#39;s not likely to bring up Carol without being prompted to do so.

Some of the patrons might have gotten a better look, but the videos, at least as far as is known? Not so much.<br /><br />Of course, if this was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSI_%28franchise%29">CSI</a>, some dude would magically multiply the resolution of the image, clean it up, and get the license plate of a nearby car from a reflection in Elliot&#39;s pupil.', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2010-11-05', 'Id': 1163, 'DateStatedAboveComic': '2010-11-05'}, 1164: {'Commentary': 'I assure that those are the tops of Tedd and Grace&#39;s heads in panel one and not mushroom monsters from some far off land populated by plumbers, turtles, and princesses with considerable creepy voices and vacant personality in most of the main titles of the franchise while actually being a fun and interesting character in many of the RPGs and comic adapt--<br /><br />Wait, where was I going with this?

I gave her several over-the-top abilities and emphasized strength, allowing her to throw trucks at people. One of the gag abilities I gave her was a chest beam, which is supposed to be a power armor and/or robotic ability. In her case, however, it made her look like she literally had killer cleavage.<br /><br />Somewhat ironically, however, her power combination turned her into my most powerful and brutal character. Even her chest beam, intended as a joke power that I&#39;d intended to replace after the joke wore thin, turned out to be her best attack. Seriously, she stuck her chest out and shot a powerful beam of light that sent bad guys flying. It was ridiculous.<br /><br />In any case, I grew attached to this ridiculous character, and I wanted to settle on at least a temporary name for Elliot&#39;s super hero form, so I went with Cheerleadra.

Whether you were conscious of that being an issue or not, however, you were affected by it.<br /><br />As soon as <a href="/?date=2010-11-03">Elliot made it to Tedd&#39;s basement</a>, I started having writer&#39;s block with scripting this storyline. As one might have guessed by now, a huge part of it was the simple fact that it made sense to get in contact with both Ellen and Elliot&#39;s parents.<br /><br />Several moments at different parts of the scene were written in an effort to quickly address this plot hole and move on with life, but each one just made more plot holes. It would have been possible to not create any plot holes, but the trade off would have been huge speed bumps and further complication of the scene.<br /><br />Frankly, I like this outcome. Contact wasn&#39;t made because people made assumptions. Given that <a href="/?date=2002-07-31">error due to conclusion jumping</a> is a running theme in EGS, it&#39;s an appropriate explanation.', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2010-12-08', 'Id': 1176, 'DateStatedAboveComic': '2010-12-08'}, 1177: {'Commentary': 'I mentioned in the <a href="/?date=2010-12-08">previous comic&#39;s commentary</a> that one of the reasons I liked the in-story reasoning of not getting Ellen involved during that scene was carrying on a tradition of error by way of conclusion jumping.<br /><br />I also liked that reasoning because it gave me the idea for this comic, and I love writing scenes like this. There&#39;s a certain madness to the Dunkel household that, in my opinion, makes the Verres household look relatively sane.

While some copy/paste did occur with some (not all) of the background elements, I didn&#39;t do that for any of the characters. With Elliot and Ellen, I clearly couldn&#39;t have done that, but with Mr. and Mrs Dunkel? I think it&#39;s probably better looking by virtue of not copying and pasting them from panel to panel, but I definitely could have gotten away with it. Kevin might&#39;ve complained, but whatever.<br /><br />The paintings in the background were made by taking photos I had taken and reducing them down to simpler shapes and shades of grey. The one over Ellen and Ellen is just a landscape photo of a lake taken during winter, while the one over their parents was actually a photo of a cat chilling out in a FedEx box under a Christmas tree.<br /><br />I know that&#39;s impossible to tell from what&#39;s in the comic, but my goal wasn&#39;t to have a cat painting on the wall. I just wanted a quick way to create something that would look like a framed painting in the background that could be easily consistent in multiple panels and potentially multiple angles, and using photos I had taken as guidelines accomplished that.<br /><br />That, and it adds useless trivia to this comic!

To the point, however, Elliot and Ellen would use it loosely in any case because they simply wouldn&#39;t know better.<br /><br />Of course, I&#39;ve often been surprised by which of my characters have been described as being Goth. <a href="/?date=2008-07-09">Liz wasn&#39;t much of a surprise</a>; her design (and bad smoking habit) were inspired by a friend of mine who was a self-described goth, after all.<br /><br />The biggest surprise, however, was Susan.

I&#39;ve done out-thunk myself.<br /><br />So instead, I&#39;m going to focus on corsets. The dialogue in panel one was inspired by a conversation I had with a friend of mine. I had commented on how I thought corsets were evil, and not for a second did I expect my friend to disagree up until the point when she vehemently did.<br /><br />The reason she countered my statement was because she was familiar with modern "corsets", i.e. tops that are called corsets by the fashion industry, but only look like corsets while having none of the more sinister aspects of corsets (hence the "faux" in today&#39;s comic).<br /><br />I&#39;m an advocate of the evolution of language and meanings changing with common usage, but there are times when I am resistant to change. I see genuine corsets, the traditional ones that squished organs and were capable of causing permanent damage by design, to basically be evil in clothing form. The idea of referring to any other clothing, regardless of a similar outward appearance, just doesn&#39;t sit well with me. <br /><br />Besides which, the modern "corsets" are different enough that I believe it to be a source of unnecessary confusion.

Put another way, my surroundings (open space, objects, people, animals) might seem bigger to me one day than they did the previous day. It&#39;s difficult to explain why they seem bigger or smaller, but they just feel like they are. Not by a lot, but obviously enough that I notice it.<br /><br />One hypothesis I have as to why this happens is simple relativity. Spending enough time in a small room will make a medium sized room feel bigger by comparison, and spending time in a big room could make that same medium sized room feel smaller.<br /><br />That doesn&#39;t really explain how it basically applies to the whole world or why everything suddenly seemed much smaller to me the other day.

I don&#39;t believe my thoughts regarding what I&#39;d like to do to that person are so bad so long as I am aware of why carrying out the thoughts would be bad (be it about the morality, the consequences, or both), and don&#39;t actually turn around and punch them in the face.<br /><br />I&#39;m emphasizing the "understanding" part possibly more than necessary because I think that&#39;s important. It&#39;s one thing to be told that something is bad and shouldn&#39;t be done, but it&#39;s another to actually get why it shouldn&#39;t be done. There are plenty of rules and laws that get disobeyed on the basis that people don&#39;t understand the reasoning behind them. There are also laws and rules that get disobeyed because people do understand the reasoning, but I still consider that a step above simply not getting the point.<br /><br /><strong>Ze Witness</strong><br /><br />When initially considering who should interrupt this kiss, I was trying to come up with <a href="/?date=2010-12-20">yet another extra</a>. I thought things like "some guy could be in awe" or "some girl who&#39;s bewildered". Looking back, it so obviously had to be Rhoda, especially after <a href="/?date=2010-12-20">the last comic</a>.<br /><br /><strong>Fashion!</strong><br /><br />Nanase&#39;s outfit was an attempt to return somewhat to <a href="/?date=2002-11-16">her earlier fashion sense</a> while being a bit more sensible in what she&#39;s wearing. The initial sketches for this comic had a variety of patterns for her top, with the end result being a sort of happy medium. It&#39;s simple, but I like the look of it, and it&#39;s different enough from what&#39;s come before.<br /><br />Other than a bare midriff, I wanted her outfit to have a skirt. The detail on the top made me want to make the skirt more elaborate, but I wasn&#39;t sure what to do with it. I eventually settled on a style that, for me at least, was inspired by denim skirts. The belt, in my opinion, makes it go with the top a lot better, and the pockets help, too. <br /><br />Given the inspiration, her skirt should have a zipper in the front, but it made it more difficult to tell that it was a skirt and not shorts, particularly given the angles in this comic and my simplistic art style. She might get a skirt in the future with a zipper in the front (or maybe I&#39;ll just retcon the heck out of this skirt), but I felt it was just best to leave the zipper off. If any women in the audience have logic regarding why that was a horrible thing to do, please let me know.

I STILL can&#39;t rationalize why Mr. Verres said what he said in that old comic, and I&#39;m the one who wrote it. <em>Over eight years ago.</em> At least that grin can now be considered a, um... well, the gag&#39;s certainly not running... A glacial drift gag?<br /><br />I wouldn&#39;t necessarily say this completely solves the <a href="/?date=2010-04-21">romantic</a> <a href="/?date=2010-05-05">issues</a> between Elliot and Sarah, but a mutually shared and <a href="/?date=2004-08-11">compatible</a> <a href="/?date=2010-08-20">fantasy</a> probably can&#39;t hurt. At least, THIS mutually shared and compatible fantasy probably can&#39;t hurt.

From Sarah&#39;s perspective, Carol is in many ways similar to an older, idealized version of herself who has one of her fantasy jobs.<br /><br />In short, one of the reasons I liked the idea was because it gives Sarah a source of conflict.<br /><br /><strong>Why is Tedd in this... Oh</strong><br /><br />The fact that Tedd seems to have no reason to be in this comic until panel five reminds me of something that I, at very least, find amusing.<br /><br />The writer&#39;s of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_simpsons"><em>The Simpsons</em></a> have made note of a sort of recurring situation in their episodes, that being an out of the ordinary object, outfit, or character being present at the start of a scene. They view it as a telltale sign that the person, outfit or object is going to be part of a joke or relevant to the plot in some way in spite of contributing nothing to the scene prior to that point.<br /><br />For example, in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_Man_%28The_Simpsons_episode%29"><em>Radioactive Man</em></a> episode, Bart and Milhouse are wearing hats. The odds that those hats are somehow involved in a joke are approximately 10,000%, and sure enough, they are.<br /><br />This most commonly seems to happen with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandpa_Simpson">Grandpa Simpson</a>, who is inexplicably present in many scenes up until having a funny line or plot point to deliver. What I find amusing is that there have been times when he&#39;s been animated into a scene before the joke he was there for got cut, so he winds up just sort of being there for no apparent reason in the final cut of the show.<br /><br /><strong>Angry eyes</strong><br /><br />Those angry eyes of DOOM in panel six created a bit of a dilemma for me, namely the dilemma that I wanted it to be clear that this was artistic license and NOT Elliot doing something with his abilities. I really like <a href="/?date=2003-06-22">playing</a> <a href="/?date=2003-07-10">around</a> with the visuals, but at this point in the comic, it can be tricky to make it clear what is and isn&#39;t truly happening.<br /><br />In most cases, it&#39;s pretty obvious (I hope) what is and isn&#39;t artistic license, but something I had considered putting in panel six was a sort of fire effect in the background. Given existing canon, however, that&#39;s something Elliot could actually <a href="/?date=2002-06-11">make</a> <a href="/?date=2002-09-25">happen</a>. It&#39;s been a while, sure, but given recent events, it didn&#39;t seem like a <a href="/?date=2010-10-08">good idea.</a><br /><br />In this case, however, I&#39;m actually sort of glad I didn&#39;t go that route.

I changed some things just to make it easier to draw and reduce how much of the park area I&#39;d need to finalize before the completion of this comic, but it&#39;s pretty darn close.<br /><br />I also didn&#39;t want there to be any dialogue, as I felt anything I could have included would have just been redundant narration from Elliot. I really like the occasional <a href="/?date=2005-08-16">silent comic</a> to the point where I might do an entire short storyline someday free of any dialogue or narration, but I probably won&#39;t get to that for a while.<br /><br />...I just realized that silent comic I just linked to is oddly appropriate. I&#39;m going to claim that was intentional.', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2011-01-21', 'Id': 1194, 'DateStatedAboveComic': '2011-01-21'}, 1195: {'Commentary': '<strong>RAGE</strong><br /><br />I tend to like it when <a href="/?date=2002-02-09">Elliot</a> <a href="/?date=2003-04-29">gets</a> <a href="/?date=2008-08-01">angry</a>.

What I find interesting, however, is that this "narration" would have been in the form of <a href="/?date=2005-05-20">thought bubbles</a> in earlier comics. Back at the start of the <a href="/?date=2010-03-01">Indiana Elliot storyline</a>, I thought I was being clever by providing Elliot with a first person narration via those text boxes, but it seems like that narration boxes instead of thought bubbles has become an industry trend in comic books.<br /><br />In short, I was being less innovative and more catching up to the rest of society. Not everyone is in agreement in the narration boxes VS thought bubbles debate, but I think I prefer the narration boxes. I think the only scenario I&#39;d use the thought bubbles in these days would be if showing the thoughts of someone other than the character currently being focused on.<br /><br /><strong>Recap?</strong><br /><br />I&#39;m sure someone somewhere is looking at this comic and claiming boldly to any who will listen that it&#39;s an unnecessary recap. The fact that Melissa betrayed Justin has been brought up <a href="/?date=2010-09-01">twice</a> <a href="/?date=2010-12-31">now</a> in this storyline, and details were given during the <a href="/?date=2006-06-21">party arc</a>.<br /><br />This comic functioning as a bit of a recap, however, is more a side effect than the main point. This has less to do with recappery and more to do with Elliot&#39;s state of mind and how much he personally knows about Melissa and the situation.<br /><br />If it&#39;s fun to claim this is a recap comic, however, don&#39;t let me stop you. In fact, I&#39;ll help! This comic now has my official RECAP SEAL OF APPROVAL! This seal is valid everywhere on Earth except Arizona.

I wrote the "make straight men see rainbows" line without thinking much about it or trying to be clever, and then paused.

If it was inspired by something I&#39;ve heard before and have since forgotten, this must be a paraphrased version of it.<br /><br />As such, Noah&#39;s "I might be misquoting something" line in panel six is 100% sincere.

For one thing, it dawned on me that while Melissa&#39;s actual presence during the discussion wouldn&#39;t work, she was basically being treated like Maris from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frasier"><em>Frasier</em></a>, a character often referenced but never seen.<br /><br />This presented a slight complication for writing this comic, as I wanted her to depart pretty quickly. It&#39;s a bit awkward, but given Elliot&#39;s reaction to her, I feel that&#39;s pretty genuine.

Me-thinks Justin has his own theories about Tedd. It&#39;s weird when characters reach conclusions on their own like that.<br /><br />Speaking of conclusion reaching, one can conclude for themselves how much Grace-Elliot is actually wearing in panel five, but given that it&#39;s Justin&#39;s fantasy, I&#39;m going to go out on a limb and assume "long pants" isn&#39;t the right answer.<br /><br />It&#39;s been commented on when I&#39;ve done <a href="/?date=2003-07-28">previous</a> <a href="/?date=2006-06-28">comics</a> <a href="/?date=2007-01-15">with</a> <a href="/?date=2007-11-24">shirtless</a> <a href="/?date=2010-12-14">males</a>, but it&#39;s well-documented that I don&#39;t draw nipples on them.

Now that I&#39;ve actually drawn hippy Grace, it will take much restraint to not keep drawing her like that because I think she looks great that way.<br /><br />I&#39;m not an expert on hippies, and part of that is, much like the spelling, that there doesn&#39;t seem to be a consensus regarding what a "hippy" is.

One might think this is because it was an early story idea that became problematic later on, but no! I&#39;m totally going somewhere with the fact that it&#39;s unreliable! See?

Nonetheless, I don&#39;t think anyone should worry until spandex-clad super villains start holding up banks and shouting "curses" as they&#39;re foiled.<br /><br />Actually, that sounds pretty awesome. First villain? Captain Badgerpants.

Part of the issue is that when grabbing someone from behind and trying to get an actual hold of them, it&#39;s kind of hard to avoid the chest region.<br /><br />Not that I have experience with such behavior, mind you. I use nets fired from pressurized air cannons.<br /><br />So long as I&#39;m mentioning the grabbing I should note that one should most definitely NOT imitate these holds. The hold Grace is in is known as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_hold#Full_nelson">full nelson</a>, which can be very dangerous. Grabbing people by the arms is less dangerous, but they could still flip out and elbow you or something.

One difference between my research then and now, however, is that I primarily searched for pictures of Bulldog skeletons, as I really wanted to understand their physical structure.<br /><br />I was not prepared for what I found. Bulldog skulls are, put simply, absurd. The skulls I saw had under-bites so severe that I think the human equivalent would have the lower jaw sticking out an inch or two past the upper jaw.<br /><br />It may not be apparent from the angle in the <a href="/?date=2011-04-18">previous comic</a>, but I tried to reflect that in the Taurcanis. The nose sticks out a bit, but the actual upper teeth are further back, pretty much directly under the eyes.<br /><br />I also learned that bulldogs are so-named because they were bred for fighting bulls. This might seem obvious to some ("they&#39;re called bulldogs! DUH!), but I always used to think the name was in reference to the shape of their bulky bodies and possibly their demeanor.

The idea was that you could remove parts of the dinosaurs to reveal "battle damage!"<br /><br />Even as a kid, I found this disturbing. Not because of the basic concept of having a way to make the toys look like they&#39;ve been in fierce battle, but because the <em>Jurassic Park</em> dinosaur battle damage basically involved removable plastic skin that would reveal red flesh and bones underneath. A bit freakishly gory for kids toys, no?<br /><br />Anyway, the point I&#39;m laboriously reaching is that whenever I draw characters in injured states, I imagine the words "BATTLE DAMAGE!" as though they were being said in a toy commercial.

You really know what to <a href="/?date=2011-03-21">latch onto...</a><br /><br />Come to think of it, I seem to remember the JP toys referring to it as "Dino Damage", so maybe I heard "Battle Damage" somewhere else.

With <a href="/?date=2010-10-20">mild-mannered</a>, it was pretty simple, and with <a href="/?date=2010-12-15">goth</a>, I just wanted an outfit that was a bit over-the-top but clearly what one might picture as being goth. With party... what does one wear to parties? What was I gonna do, put a lampshade on her head?<br /><br />Most of the various searches I did aren&#39;t worth mentioning and didn&#39;t turn up anything that would be useful for me.

She was going to be energetic, so mostly light clothing and sneakers instead of anything like high heels. The skirt naturally adds femininity, as does the cropped cardigan (that&#39;s right--I know what a cardigan is now), and I think the layered nature of the skirt makes it look a bit more wild and party-appropriate.<br /><br />The sunglasses are possibly the exception to form following function in my opinion, mostly because I picture most parties happening at night. BUT! Parties may well begin before the sun sets, particularly in summer, and know when you might want sunglasses? RIGHT THEN. That, and they&#39;re great when posing in embarrassing photos for Facebook.<br /><br />I personally like the look. Unlike a lot of the outfits I have in this comic, I can picture someone actually wearing this. Something like Melissa&#39;s outfit isn&#39;t that bad until you consider that it&#39;s her casual wear, and I guess a lot of the generic stuff characters wear is alright... okay, I take that back.

I&#39;m sure someone out there hates the outfit, but they&#39;ve yet to bother e-mailing me about it.<br /><br />One thing I found a bit perplexing, however, is that at least a few people assumed that the <a href="/?date=2010-12-15">"exorbitant breadth" text from Elliot&#39;s spellbook</a> was in reference to this party form, leading those same people to expect party Elliot to be more, um, generously endowed.

I think this sort of backfired in panel one, as the pose I drew for Carol turned out to be somewhat exaggerated. What&#39;s in the comic is actually my attempt to tone it down a bit, but it sort of looks like she&#39;s balancing on something.<br /><br />You know what? Maybe she is. We can&#39;t see her feet.

Or, at least, I thought it was. I fully expected to build this comic entirely around Tedd&#39;s "nothing" response, but then I, too, was reminded of the simple fact that they wound up designing and using four custom male variants for <a href="/?date=2005-05-23">Grace&#39;s birthday party.</a><br /><br />Now granted, I know most people asking the question aren&#39;t really asking from the perspective of what would Tedd logically program into the gun or whatever. It&#39;s more likely that they just want to see a male equivalent of the FV5 transformation, which I would argue is an easy thing to imagine. It would just be a male transformation that results in a form that basically fits a criteria of attractiveness set by whoever programmed it.<br /><br />For example, it&#39;s entirely possible that such a form programmed by Amanda would result in something that looks like Raven, based on the state of her buttons.<br /><br />What actually further complicates the easy is that by the time we got to Grace&#39;s party, Tedd had constructed two TF guns. Each gun can be programmed with different forms and variants, so it&#39;s entirely possible that the fifth variant of a form on one gun could be completely different on the other. So, yes, there IS a MV5 on at least one of the TF guns, but it might not even be there on the other.<br /><br />Maybe we need to add another letter to the abbreviations? MV5a and MV5b, perhaps?

I think it was actually a joke, but it got me thinking (which is always dangerous) about how elves are often portrayed and how it seems contrary to a race of beings adapted to being stealthy in a forest environment.<br /><br />The way I see, skin tone is less of an issue with their stealth than the supposed cleanliness and lack of body hair. A grizzled hairy dude would blend in quite well with a forest environment. Ever seen a lumberjack? No? Well, now you know why.<br /><br />Even more effective would be fur.

I&#39;m guessing they would be a sight to see around Christmas time.<br /><br />It&#39;s a common fantasy and sci-fi trope that fictional races are singular in their cultures, which I suspect is often because those races are acting as allegories for one or more real cultures.

Noah specifically stated <a href="/?date=2010-03-31">his parents aren&#39;t alive</a>, and I&#39;d like to think that Raven would refer to Noah as his nephew or whatever if they were blood relatives as opposed to just "I&#39;m his guardian".

I can nitpick time travel in general.<br /><br />Whether or not it&#39;s actually possible is something I&#39;m not interested in seriously debating because, short of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS">TARDIS</a> materializing, we&#39;re not settling anything. A casual discussion about it could be interesting, but it&#39;s been my experience that the sort of people likely to discuss these things are also the sort of people who are prone to getting into heated debates on these subjects (myself included, depending on the topic).<br /><br />As for time travel in fiction, I felt the need to point out that I don&#39;t think it&#39;s universally a bad thing.

The former is almost entirely built around time travel, and the latter sprinkles it about like, well, sprinkles.<br /><br />That said, I feel time travel in the wrong story or series can really mess things up, and I don&#39;t want to give any of the characters in EGS an "undo button". If something happens, it happened. They can do their best to fix it, but they don&#39;t get to go backward to do it.<br /><br />Besides which, EGS already has alternate universes.

I really, really want to say more about it, but it&#39;s occurred to me that such elaboration will unfold naturally through the course of the story and I probably should save it for then, so I&#39;m going to move on before I trip over my own line of thought.<br /><br /><strong>The wuv limitation</strong><br /><br />A common rule in stories with magic is that it&#39;s not possible to make people fall in love. Not TRUE love, anyway, and I guess if it&#39;s the result of magic, putting the word "true" in there wouldn&#39;t really make sense in any event.<br /><br />Nonetheless, assuming all those scientist guys over there in the corner coffee hut are correct and love is the result of scientific mumbo-jumbo, then I don&#39;t see why magic couldn&#39;t accomplish such a thing. I can think of all sorts of problems that would result if the people involved weren&#39;t genuinely compatible, but my point is simply that the whole "wuv" feeling should theoretically be possible to replicate, at least temporarily.<br /><br />That whole idea, however, is fairly creepy, so I can&#39;t help but think the reason it&#39;s a rule is often just because of that.

I got a fair amount of responses asking things along the lines of "does that mean _____ is possible?" The answer is as this comic says: Raven was only saying they can&#39;t know what isn&#39;t possible. That doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t things magic can&#39;t do. It just means they don&#39;t know what those things are.<br /><br /><strong>Flying, Ponies and Birds</strong><br /><br />Okay, yes, I brought up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony_Friendship_Is_Magic">My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</a> again, but gosh diddly darn it, it works here.

I suspect most of us have seen footage of man&#39;s early attempts at flight, and it&#39;s fun to laugh at now, but we had to go through that sort of wackiness to figure this stuff out.<br /><br />In the course of making this comic, I myself asked that question and searched for answers. One of those answers had joke potential, but the setup would have been tricky to the point that I decided it wasn&#39;t worth it. Basically, one of the reasons birds can fly is that instead of having a lot of muscles in their wings (thus making them heavier), the bulk of their muscles are in their chests. Nanase, bulky chest... I dunno. I could&#39;ve done something with that, but it would have been so, so forced, especially since she her arms aren&#39;t even doing the flapping.<br /><br />All that said, I like the idea Raven proposes here. Do the wings allow them to fly by traditional means? No. Are they using those wings to fly anyway? Yes!

I really can&#39;t imagine why I didn&#39;t update the commentary for that comic sooner, but it really is the best solution.<br /><br />As for a more thorough answer regarding EGS:NP, coming up with ideas for it usually isn&#39;t that hard.

I know many of you would like to frequently see Grace with super extra fuzzy antennae, but it&#39;s hard enough to plan panel layouts around her regular antennae, darn it!<br /><br />I&#39;m intentionally vague about the exact dates of each panel, but exactly "when" we are after all this panel-by-panel time jumps will be made clear soon enough.<br /><br /><strong>SCIENCE!</strong><br /><br />Everything Tedd says in this comic has a basis in something real. Well, "real" relative to the comic&#39;s universe, anyway. None of it is random or purely gibberish. That doesn&#39;t necessarily mean Tedd&#39;s right about what he&#39;s saying in every panel, just that there&#39;s an actual reason for each thing said.<br /><br />It would not surprise me if the stuff Tedd&#39;s talking about sounds like one or more games out there. There are, like, a bazillion million games with magic systems out there. There&#39;s gotta be at least a few that every separate stats for "spells" and "enchantments". Anyway, my point is that this isn&#39;t supposed to be based on anything beyond generic magic mumbo-jumbo.<br /><br /><strong>Testing Device</strong><br /><br />The Uryuom testing device has seen little use in the comic, and has undergone a bit of an appearance upgrade over time. While I&#39;ve tried to stick to something similar to what is seen when Ellen first uses it, I&#39;ve made it closer to the ground. I can buy that the Uryuoms designed the thing to be accessible to a variety of differently sized species, especially considering that they can morph themselves, but I could not buy that they would make it so high up that a human would have to be standing to use it when Uryuoms themselves are <a href="/?date=2003-08-28">relatively short</a>.<br /><br />Well, <a href="/?date=2011-01-12">usually</a>.

For one thing, there&#39;s a curtain between the half of the basement Tedd uses and the more utilitarian half of the basement (they have to put their water heater and stuff SOMEWHERE down there). I got tired of putting a vague "nothing to see here" gradient of shadows there, and a sliding curtain makes more sense to me than putting in a door. Easy to install, easy to get around (even if it&#39;s closed and one is carrying something), reduced chance of accidental <a href="/?date=2006-08-16">Jeremy</a> trapping, etc.<br /><br />My favorite change that is only barely visible and not really identifiable in this comic is behind Tedd in panel one.

Shown from any new angle, yes, adding the details of every last locker door does get complicated. When it&#39;s an angle that&#39;s already been done, however, the fact that I work in vectors mean I usually don&#39;t have to make anything new. I just have to resize, position and put a mask* over each panel&#39;s background as necessary.<br /><br />In short, that&#39;s pretty much all I had to do for this comic&#39;s backgrounds given that I had already made the lockers from this angle for the last two comics. I usually don&#39;t have that luxury, but when I can legitimately do that (i.e. it fits the scene and isn&#39;t just laziness), I am soooo happy.<br /><br />This helped me during the <a href="/?date=2011-07-04">Q&A</a> as well.

During  <a href="/index.php?arcid=84">the last Q&A</a>, it felt much more natural drawing Amanda than any of the other female characters, as she&#39;s taller than average and has been six and a half head lengths vertically for a while now.

Although there was this guy hanging out there who looked like a teenage goth <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethan_Suplee">Ethan Suplee</a>. That was kind of cool.<br /><br />I haven&#39;t been to a bowling alley to actually attempt to bowl since 2009, and when I say "attempt to bowl", I don&#39;t mean that as a self deprecating jab at my bowling skill. I mean the reason I know with certainty that it was 2009 was that the wait to actually get a free lane for bowling was long enough that my friends and I gave up on it and went to see the 2009 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes_%282009_film%29"><em>Sherlock Holmes</em></a> movie instead.<br /><br />I have no idea whether business for bowling alleys is on the rise, decline, or unchanged, but I do know that night was not unique in terms of bowling alleys being busy. So, yeah. I don&#39;t know if this remains an accurate portrayal of bowling alleys on a Friday night in some places, but at the very least, this is a fairly accurate representation of bowling attendance at one point in history in one part of the world.<br /><br /><strong>More about purses (yay)</strong><br /><br />This comic got me thinking about purses and the inconveniences thereof again. I was thinking of giving Nanase a purse at this point, which wouldn&#39;t have been contrary to continuity. She wasn&#39;t shown with one before, but that doesn&#39;t mean she didn&#39;t have one in the car and subsequently under the table.<br /><br />I then started thinking about having to keep track of the purse not only while bowling, but while doing things in the arcade. Would it be physically comfortable to keep wearing one while playing one of those games? Would it be emotionally comfortable to set it down somewhere in a place like that? There&#39;s the leaving it in the care option, but they&#39;re not just parked briefly in Tedd&#39;s driveway at this point. I know I wouldn&#39;t want to leave my wallet in the car. Of course, I suppose there&#39;d be a wallet within the purse, and the purse could be left in the car and the wallet brought along...<br /><br />I am seriously going to start paying more attention to what women do with their purses and asking questions as I think of them.

The date of this date is May 3rd, so that&#39;s February, March, April and some change. I am the first to admit that there <em>probably</em> should have been more time jumps earlier on.<br /><br /><strong>Who&#39;s saying what now?</strong><br /><br />One of the worst mistakes a comic maker can make is pointing a dialogue bubble at the wrong character.

This can be hard to do, as the desire to clarify my intentions is often strong, but if I don&#39;t want something to be widely open to interpretation and instead be definitive, the place to do it is in the story itself.

Granted, I&#39;m not sure if Spanish settlers were the only people to bring European Boars over to the United States, but they&#39;re the ones I keep seeing getting credit for bringing the European Boars over. From what I understand, feral hogs these days are commonly hybrids of those and domestic pigs, which is apparently resulting in bigger animals.<br /><br />As for reproducing "at an alarming rate", that alarming rate is as many as two litters a year with 4-8 hogs per litter. Plenty of animals have them beat, but most of the animals that do are smaller and have built in population control in the form of natural predators. Feral hogs throw things completely out of balance for native species, groups of them <a href="/index.php?arcid=89">rooting</a> can destroy entire fields, and on top of all this, they can grow to weigh several hundred pounds and have razor sharp tusks, and even the small ones can be dangerous.<br /><br />Now, I&#39;m not going to be too judgmental of settlers bringing them over in the 16th century. I can pretty much guarantee that any one of us would have thought bringing them over as livestock and whatnot was a good idea back then. Heck, we probably would&#39;ve felt like smarty pants for doing so. We didn&#39;t have the <a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/">Discovery channel</a> back then letting us know that introducing non-native species into an environment could be disastrous.<br /><br />What I WILL be judgmental about, however, is that in spite of the fact that these feral hogs are an ecological disaster, people import Russian boars into the country for the purpose of hunting them in fenced in habitats. Granted, hunting animals in fenced habitats is something I&#39;d wag my finger at anyway, but there are just all sorts of levels of public endangerment here.<br /><br />I would like to clarify something after that last paragraph, however: I am not universally anti-hunting. I feel it should always have a purpose beyond recreation, be it to put food on a table, keep an overblown animal population under control, protection, etc, and that the animal should not go to waste. SOMEONE should get one or more meals out of it.<br /><br />Incidentally, would you believe that when I got started working out this storyline, I was simply inspired by the fact that wild pigs can actually get pretty darn huge under the right conditions?

Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;ve never owned a dog and have never hunted, but I just think about putting my cat in danger hunting something bigger than it and thinking there wouldn&#39;t be body armor sturdy enough.

I&#39;m trying to change this habit, as it&#39;s better to completely draw out the characters as minimalistic (but proportionately accurate) stick figures.<br /><br />The stick figure approach really does make sense, as it&#39;s much easier to draw the basis for poses and make corrections, and once that&#39;s all in order, it&#39;s a lot faster to do the more detailed sketches over them. It&#39;s especially easier when sketching on the computer, where I can have each step on a separate layer.<br /><br />For the record, it&#39;s going well. I&#39;m getting faster at drawing poses in general and more complex poses are easier... WHEN I remember to draw out the stick figures in their entirety before adding more detail.

I hadn&#39;t read the instruction booklet (I don&#39;t think I had my own copy of the game yet), and apparently, neither had my friend who owned the game. When I asked what the point of all the running around and throwing vegetables was, his answer was as follows:<br /><br />"To save the day."<br /><br />That was it. That was the extent of his reasoning. Apparently, there was a day that needed saving, and throwing vegetables at people was the way to do it. What did it mean to save the day, and why did it need saving? He refused to elaborate further. There was a day that needed saving, and your ragtag team of plumbers, a princess and a toadstool were the people to get it done. End of story.<br /><br />I would say something like "ah, the logic of a child", but I was a child then, too, and I guarantee you that the reason I remember this story was that I was frustrated by his answer. I don&#39;t think he was messing with me, though. I think he didn&#39;t care about the story and "saving the day" was good enough for him.

Beyond simply not drawing as well, there are a variety of "what the hell" sort of mistakes I am very prone to making if I draw when too hungry. Here are a few of them (the first one happened while sketching panel four of this comic):<br /><br /> - Flipping the positions of the characters<br /> - Drawing entirely the wrong character<br /> - Drawing the wrong emotion on a character<br /> - Putting characters in the wrong outfits and forgetting accessories<br /><br />And my personal favorite:<br /><br /> - Drawing Tedd as the wrong gender.<br /><br />It&#39;s possible that last one has happened with other characters, but I can only recall with any certainty it happening with Tedd. It doesn&#39;t even have to be a scene where any transformation is going on, either. Tedd just sometimes winds up being a guy or a girl when he&#39;s supposed to be the opposite. Fortunately, it&#39;s not that difficult to correct that sort of mistake when it&#39;s Tedd.<br /><br /><strong>Grace&#39;s alignment continued</strong><br /><br />In the <a href="/?date=2011-12-05">previous comic&#39;s commentary</a>, I asked what Grace&#39;s alignment would be where she a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons"><em>D&D</em></a> character.

This comic actually proved pretty easy to draw, however, as what usually makes it difficult is drawing characters repeatedly at the same angle who aren&#39;t moving much and keeping everything consistent. Both Grace and Tedd move around a fair amount in this comic, so it didn&#39;t really feel much like drawing a static camera comic.<br /><br />It&#39;s a bit paradoxical, but it&#39;s something I&#39;m going to keep note of for the future: more varied poses are easier and more fun than less varied poses.

As I looked at references for poses of tying one&#39;s shoes while sitting on a chair or sofa, however, it became evident that Noah&#39;s face would wind up being obscured, and I&#39;d have to be very careful drawing it to make certain it was at all clear what he was doing.<br /><br />As such, panel three wound up making just that much less sense.

Ever seen a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squirrel#Characteristics">rodent&#39;s skull?</a> It&#39;s almost like they have two completely different sets of teeth, and the only reason I say "almost" is because I&#39;m not an expert on the official classifications of rodent dentistry. From my everyday layman dude perspective, however, there is a considerable separation between the front and back of their chompers. That&#39;s not a face I want to give Grace.<br /><br /><strong>Squirrel Size</strong><br /><br />I&#39;ve gone back and forth on how big Grace should be in her squirrel form over the years, but I&#39;ve basically settled on her being a little over 90.6% of her human form size. It doesn&#39;t sound like that huge a difference, but it basically amounts to a six inch height difference, making her <a href="/?date=2010-12-29">even shorter than Rhoda</a> in her half-Squirrel form.<br /><br />What I find sort of interesting, however, is that she doesn&#39;t LOOK that much shorter than she did before to me, and I&#39;m fairly certain it&#39;s due to the antennae. I can look at panel one and know she&#39;s much shorter than Raven, and yet the antennae are messing up my perception of the height difference in spite of knowing that Raven is 6&#39; to Grace&#39;s 4&#39;10" in that panel.<br /><br />I have new found respect for the defense mechanisms of various animals and the animals who are put off guard by them. It may look a little silly when a cat puffs up their fur and such, but that sort optical illusion&#39;s got weight to it, man.

Humans are really good at knocking the food chain out of whack by adding or removing animals from it, and that will really mess up an ecosystem. If humans create a situation where there is no natural predator to keep the populations of other species under control, then we get the grim task of picking up the slack.

Still, I have to wonder if I&#39;m going to find myself in a situation someday where the best thing I could do for nature would be to selectively shoot at it.<br /><br />Also of course (because I apparently like starting paragraphs with "of course" so much), if the food chain is messed up because an animal has been removed from it, a less shooty approach is to try and reintroduce that missing animal. I know this has been attempted in some places with wolves, though I&#39;m not sure how successful or popular that approach has been.

Where the hell did that come from?"<br /><br />Basically, the magic, Grace transforming, Raven&#39;s ears tasting things, etc, all make perfect sense to me, but my mind would boggle at the idea of Raven having an orange vest for Grace ready to go on such short notice.', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2012-01-16', 'Id': 1379, 'DateStatedAboveComic': '2012-01-16'}, 1380: {'Commentary': '<em>For one day, Wednesday, January 18, 2012, this comic included a warning message about SOPA, and the commentary was also modified.

Whenever I attempted to picture a "Ravenized" Grace, Susan would come to mind.<br /><br />Of course, whether that fact has inspired anything beyond this moment remains to be seen. Maybe it inspired a big huge convoluted plot twist that will one day reveal that Raven is Susan&#39;s father oh wait he can&#39;t have kids.

The orange vests made sense to me, but I am not an experienced hunter. In fact, the closest I&#39;ve come to hunting was trying to <a href="/?date=2012-01-09">get a chipmunk out of my home.</a> As such, I wondered if I had made a mistake.<br /><br />Filled with concern, I turned to the highest power I know: <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/dantheshive">The Twitters</a>. The general response I got was that wearing camouflage was a good way to get yourself shot, and that other hunters would likely see someone moving and potentially shoot them even with camouflage.<br /><br />The orange vests, on the other hand, are an immediate visual shorthand to other hunters that you are not a valid target. What&#39;s more, depending on what one is hunting, the prey might not even be able to see the orange, so one can even be camouflaged to their prey while remaining a clear non-target to other hunters.<br /><br />Now, I&#39;m not going on about this to gloat about apparently being right. I&#39;m going on about this because camouflage being safer is apparently not only a misconception that exists, but a misconception that can get a person killed. I&#39;m in favor of encouraging behavior that keeps my readers alive and safe, so I felt I should share the feedback I received.<br /><br />That, and I was apparently right about something!

It&#39;s not just some random mathematical principle I thought would sound cool to mention, either. It&#39;s directly applicable to a boar made giant.<br /><br />Were the boar not in defiance of the square-cube law, it would tell Raven a few things. The boar&#39;s proportions would be different to support its weight and keep trivial bodily functions, such as its cardiovascular system, working. I imagine this would result in a bulkier, slower, but stronger boar.<br /><br />The fact that it IS in defiance of the square-cube law, however, suggests that its proportions are unchanged, or changed in a way that doesn&#39;t necessarily make sense.

This wouldn&#39;t have literally been the boar talking, as it would have just been a translation of what the boar was communicating to Grace, but it&#39;d be too close to the literal approach of the boar spontaneously speaking English for my liking.<br /><br />I actually did write dialogue for the boar, which is ironically what made me realize that the dialogue wasn&#39;t necessary.

This is a piece of information that I keep trying to shove into the dialogue, but never really fits. This comic was the closest I&#39;ve gotten to getting it to fit, but it just seemed more natural for Raven to focus on the sound and not the biology lesson of boar tusk sharpening.<br /><br />The whole "clak" thing isn&#39;t based on anything specific I&#39;ve read or been told, but on observed behavior. I&#39;ve never been boar hunting (shocking!), but I have seen footage of people hunting and capturing live boar, and that appears to be a genuine behavior of threatened boars. I believe two valid translations for "clak", depending on the context, are "back off before I make you back off" and "I am going to gore the hell out of you the second I get free of these ropes."<br /><br />As for why I spell it "clak" and not "clack"? I don&#39;t really know. I&#39;m doing it that way now for the sake of consistency, but I honestly don&#39;t know why past me left out the second "c". I have a tendency to treat proper spelling as little more than a suggestion when it comes to sound effects, but I&#39;m not sure what my issue was with the "c".

Personally, I find it odd that anyone would consider it to be a choice, as attraction in general doesn&#39;t work that way. If physical attraction was a conscious decision, life would be a lot simpler. For just one of many examples, cleavage would be significantly less powerful.<br /><br />This is the sort of thing that makes me wonder, however, whether everyone who claims "homosexuality is a choice" is saying what they are commonly interpreted as saying. What I am saying is that the ATTRACTION is not a choice. I sometimes wonder if some people are only referring to actually ACTING on that attraction as being the choice. If that were the case, then technically, yes, that&#39;s a choice. Acting or not acting on any attraction would be a choice.<br /><br />Of course, I feel the choice to act on an attraction shared by consenting adults is nobody&#39;s business but their own and it should be perfectly acceptable, but my point is that I&#39;m simply not sure if everyone&#39;s actually arguing about what they think they&#39;re arguing about.<br /><br />I know with a fair amount of certainty, however, that there are plenty of people who are genuinely arguing that the attraction itself is a choice. Once during a debate in a college business psychology class (because god forbid we discuss the actual course material), someone made the claim that it was just the appeal of the lifestyle that made people gay. The argument basically boiled down to it not being based at all in naturally occurring physical attraction, but in the gay party scene being <em>just that awesome.</em><br /><br />As much as the whole "homophobes are actually gay themselves" argument is more based on people enjoying irony than solid data, I can&#39;t help but hear an argument like that and think that, if it makes sense to them, they&#39;ve gotta be at <em>least</em> bi-curious.', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2012-02-27', 'Id': 1401, 'DateStatedAboveComic': '2012-02-27'}, 1402: {'Commentary': '<a href="/?date=2010-01-11">- "Just a phase"</a><br /><br />CURSE THAT KITCHEN!

For example, I could have turned cooking the spaghetti dinner into some sort of mini-game where Ellen has to give Nanase the right ingredients quickly enough for maximum XP!

As far as she knew, she was unapologetically outing two people, AND she refused to run any sort of correction when they tell her they&#39;re not gay because she doesn&#39;t believe them.<br /><br />In short, I find the journalist character in the episode to be absolutely horrible to the point of frustration, which might have even worked if the character had some sort of comeuppance or learned something, but she didn&#39;t.

If Elliot can dodge that spell or resist its effects upon impact with his spell resistance, he won&#39;t turn into a catgirl. <br /><br />If he can&#39;t avoid or resist the spell, however, the spell places the catgirl transformation enchantment upon him, at which point the strength of the enchantment and his enchantment resistance will determine how long it lasts.<br /><br />I personally like this sort of distinction, as it can make for varied types of magic vulnerability all on its own. For example, someone with no spell resistance, but high enchantment resistance, would be easy to enchant, but the enchantments would be relatively short-lived. Someone with those extremes reversed would be very difficult to enchant, but once enchanted, would remain so for a much longer time.<br /><br />Of course, your average person in the EGS universe has practically none of either form of resistance.

It might have been the first idea I had for the card game part in the first place, but I&#39;m not sure about that. The order of ideas can be difficult to keep track of when brainstorming.<br /><br />The land growing around them concept is also why this is one comic instead of two in spite of the fact that it could have worked as two separate updates.

This has to do with cat moods and how you can tell a thing or two about what they&#39;re feeling by their tails. I could have emphasized this more by having Grace look down, but I think that would have just made it look like she was looking...

It&#39;s two different definitions of "record", but it just sounded weird, and I kept coming up with wordier and wordier alternatives.

Going by the storyline&#39;s title, the obvious answer is, of course, a whale.<br /><br />There are, however, a few problems with this. Whales are giant fish that live in large ponds, and even the smallest whale known to man is the size of two and a half Godzillas.

The destructive power of a human sized kitty would be enormous, not to mention a lack of room to actually do things without colliding into something.<br /><br />On the plus side, that provided a good segue into a discussion showing Sarah&#39;s enthusiasm for trying out some transformations, which is something I wanted to show after <a href="/?date=2012-11-02">the previous comic</a> she was in.<br /><br />It also provided an opportunity to address how much the TF gun can currently scale size up and down. Grace&#39;s point in panel three about how things scale is in reference to the square cube law, which has <a href="/?date=2012-01-23">come up before.</a> Since three dimensional objects have, well, three dimensions, something twice as big in scale would actually be eight times as big in terms of things like volume (2 * 2 * 2, or 2 cubed).<br /><br />Which brings us to why I chose the numbers I did for Tedd&#39;s current scaling limitations. The more mathematical among you might have realized this before reaching this sentence, but the cube root of 2 is around 1.2599 (i.e. approximately 1.26). It is my understanding that this means that something that is scaled up to about 126% normal size would double their volume and mass.<br /><br />As for eighty percent ( 0.8 ), that&#39;s rounded up from approximately 0.7937. Multiply that by 1.2599, and you get 1. In short, it&#39;s intended to be half the volume, meaning the TF gun and watches are capable of halving or doubling an individual&#39;s original volume and mass.<br /><br />Of course, I&#39;m not a math or physics expert. There could be something I&#39;m missing, BUT EITHER WAY, that&#39;s why I picked those numbers.<br /><br />Incidentally, the original script included Grace mentioning the whole conservation of mass dealie and how it was really amazing that they could change such things at all in light of that, but the third panel was getting crowded and I cared more about bringing up how scaling works because I find that more interesting and it&#39;s an excuse to make graphs detailing how much scale would change if they halved their volume at each stage (it&#39;s a really neat graph; I&#39;ll have to share it sometime).', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2012-11-16', 'Id': 1523, 'DateStatedAboveComic': '2012-11-16'}, 1524: {'Commentary': '<a href="/?date=2005-12-14">- Ellen resenting Sarah&#39;s fear of transforming</a><br /><br /><em>Pssst!</em> Hey!

Before I list them, I will note that many of their videos do contain a fair amount of swearing and other content some may find objectionable. Such things don&#39;t really bother me, but fairly warned be ye.<br /><br />The real critics are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Angry_Video_Game_Nerd">The Angry Video Game Nerd</a> (James Rolfe), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nostalgia_Critic">The Nostalgia Critic</a> (Doug Walker), and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spoony_Experiment">Spoony</a> (Noah Antwiler).

I really shouldn&#39;t care, but part of me is all like "no my interpretation is the bestest of all the interpretations...!"<br /><br />Of course, that&#39;s specific to Sam&#39;s character and his motivations.

Complaining about &quot;fake geek girls&quot; is a thing.</p>\n<p>A thing most of you have probably heard about, but I&#39;m holding out hope that there are readers who have never even heard of this sort of thing before on account of everyone they&#39;ve met being so accepting of geeky women (which, assuming we go strictly by women I&nbsp;personally know, is around 90%&nbsp;of all women).</p>\n<p>I&nbsp;actually did draw Tedd as female in panel five, but that just means the torso is slightly different (and it makes even less of a difference with those two guys in the way).

I&nbsp;guess it would be for entirely Tedd-like reasons no matter how you spin it.</p>\n<p>Anyway, there are genuine things to consider from a &quot;how the heck would that work&quot;&nbsp;standpoint, such as how shadows and lighting would work.

Magic could just be like &quot;you see right through clothes&quot;, and you&#39;d have to just be like &quot;fine, WHATEVER&quot;, because it&#39;s magic, and it doesn&#39;t have to explain itself.</p>\n<p>And yet even THAT&nbsp;begs questions. For one thing, clothing presses against skin and stuff.

Assuming he didn&#39;t go to the beach over the summer (he didn&#39;t), the answer is &quot;easily&quot;. Unless Justin has a habit of removing his shirt in front of people who are likely to observe his back and share said observations, or posing in various twisted poses in front of a mirror, a small, low contrast mark between his shoulder blades is something that can easily be missed.</p>\n<p>Now, to be fair, in the comic where I show <a href="/index.php?id=1837">the marks</a>, they are super easy to spot. This is because I wanted readers to be able to see them clearly without any difficulty across several monitors with varying settings throughout the universe. In short, I upped the contrast (which everyone should have automatically known because REASONS).</p>\n<p>And yes, Grace swears more in her thoughts. Just a little bit, though. Her thoughts could probably be aired on prime time television just fine for the most part.</p>\n<p><strong><a href="http://www.patreon.com/egscomics">Patreon</a> Funded Commentaries</strong></p>\n<p><a href="/index.php?id=26">Feb 15</a> - <a href="/index.php?id=27">Feb 16</a> - <a href="/index.php?id=48">Feb 17</a> - <a href="/index.php?id=28">Feb 18</a>, 2002</p>', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2014-08-12', 'Id': 1925, 'DateStatedAboveComic': '2014-08-12'}, 1926: {'Commentary': '<p><a href="/index.php?id=878">- Super math powers</a><br />\n<a href="/index.php?id=1035">- Floating girl on the news</a></p>\n<p>&quot;Captain, our sensors are picking some strange readers.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;What is it, Lieutenant?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;It appears to be a creepy little girl of unfathomable power.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Not again.&quot;</p>\n<p>Actually, I can&#39;t remember if they ever dealt with a super powered little girl on <em>Star Trek</em>.

I&#39;m not actually sure, but I know less often than with other combinations, so there.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.patreon.com/egscomics"><strong>Patreon funded</strong></a></p>\n<p><a href="/egsnp.php?id=201">EGS:NP</a> - <a href="/sketchbook.php?id=795">Sketchbook</a></p>\n<p><strong>Commentaries</strong><br />\n<a href="/index.php?id=116">May 16</a> - <a href="/index.php?id=117">May 17</a> - <a href="/index.php?id=118">May 18</a>, 2002</p>', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2014-09-19', 'Id': 1952, 'DateStatedAboveComic': '2014-09-19'}, 1953: {'Commentary': '<p><a href="http://www.egscomics.com/index.php?id=1915">- Justin earring explanation</a><br />\n<a href="http://www.egscomics.com/index.php?id=1917">- Justin deciding to wear one</a><br />\n<a href="/index.php?id=1922">- Glint #1</a><br />\n<a href="/index.php?id=1939">- Glint #2</a></p>\n<p>I&#39;m expecting reader rage, so I&#39;m going to finish this commentary quickly and then run.

Granted, that was back in early 1992, but still. In any case, it IS based in reality. Depending on what state you&#39;re in, it&#39;s legal to have security cameras in there in the USA.

The people monitoring have to be the same gender, they have to put up signs, and it isn&#39;t allowed in every state, but it is, in fact, a thing that happens.

Then I found myself unsure of what I wanted to draw as examples and unsatisfied with the comic&#39;s ending, so I asked <a href="https://twitter.com/elgoonishshive/status/735912439565287424">Twitter</a> to choose an animal with very little explanation as to why.

Characters are challenging enough, particularly when there are extras, but it&#39;s backgrounds and objects that really makes things difficult for me. I underestimated the challenge the overall composition posed back when I brought color into <a href="/index.php?id=1824">Squirrel Prophet</a>, and while it could be fun and rewarding to work in color, it was horribly impractical for sticking to a schedule, and I likely would have stopped using color mid-storyline if not for the fact that almost everything was happening in one location with a reusable palette.</p>\n<p><a href="/egsnp.php?id=466">EGS:NP</a></p>', 'HtmlComicTitle': None, 'DateInBrowserTitle': '2016-05-30', 'Id': 2195, 'DateStatedAboveComic': '2016-05-30'}, 2196: {'Commentary': '<p>Gender identity: Non-committal shrug<br />\nSexual orientation: Non-committal shrug<br />\nHot wing sauce preference: Mild</p>\n<p>This is a question I&#39;ve gotten somewhat frequently in recent years for SOME reason.</p>\n<p>If I actually felt more strongly on which pronouns were used to refer to me and truly wanted &quot;they / them&quot; or &quot;she / her&quot;, I would push for those regardless of questions from annoying random people.
